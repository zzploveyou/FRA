TI  - ICEC0942, an Orally Bioavailable Selective Inhibitor of CDK7 for Cancer
      Treatment.

AB  - Recent reports indicate that some cancer types are especially sensitive to
      transcription inhibition, suggesting that targeting the transcriptional machinery
      provides new approaches to cancer treatment. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)7 is
      necessary for transcription, and acts by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain
      (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PolII) to enable transcription initiation. CDK7
      additionally regulates the activities of a number of transcription factors,
      including Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER). Here we describe a new, orally
      bioavailable CDK7 inhibitor, ICEC0942. It selectively inhibits CDK7, with an IC50
      of 40nM; IC50 values for CDK1, CDK2, CDK5 and CDK9 were 45-, 15-, 230- and
      30-fold higher. In vitro studies show that a wide range of cancer types are
      sensitive to CDK7 inhibition with GI50 values ranging between 0.2-0.3 microM. In 
      xenografts of both breast and colorectal cancers, the drug has substantial
      anti-tumor effects. Additionally, combination therapy with tamoxifen showed
      complete growth arrest of ER-positive tumor xenografts. Our findings reveal that 
      CDK7 inhibition provides a new approach, especially for ER-positive breast cancer
      and identify ICEC0942 as a prototype drug with potential utility as a single
      agent or in combination with hormone therapies for breast cancer. ICEC0942 may
      also be effective in other cancers that display characteristics of transcription 
      factor addiction, such as acute leukaemia, and small-cell lung cancer.

TI  - Meta-Analysis of miRNAs and Their Involvement as Biomarkers in Oral Cancers.
PG  - 8439820

AB  - Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. 
      Recent studies have highlighted the role of miRNA in disease pathology,
      indicating its potential use as an early diagnostic marker. Dysregulated
      expression of miRNAs is known to affect cell growth, and these may function as
      tumor suppressors or oncogenes in various cancers. The main objective of this
      study was to characterize the extracellular miRNAs involved in oral cancer (OC)
      that can potentially be used as biomarkers of OC. A total of 318 miRNAs involved 
      in oral carcinoma were shortlisted. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of oral
      carcinoma from reported experiments were identified. Common genes between lists
      of DEGs of OC of each miRNA were identified. These common genes are the targets
      of specific miRNA, which may be used as biomarkers of OC. A list of significant
      biomarkers for cancer was generated like CDH2 and CDK7, and functional enrichment
      analysis identified the role of miRNAs in major pathways like cell adhesion
      molecules pathway affected by cancer. We observed that at least 25 genes like
      ABCF3, ALDH2, CD163L1, and so forth are regulated by a maximum number of miRNAs; 
      thereby, they can be used as biomarkers of OC.

AB  - Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) ligand-binding domain (LBD) mutations are found in a
      substantial number of endocrine treatment-resistant metastatic ER-positive
      (ER(+)) breast cancers. We investigated the chromatin recruitment,
      transcriptional network, and genetic vulnerabilities in breast cancer models
      harboring the clinically relevant ER mutations. These mutants exhibit both
      ligand-independent functions that mimic estradiol-bound wild-type ER as well as
      allele-specific neomorphic properties that promote a pro-metastatic phenotype.
      Analysis of the genome-wide ER binding sites identified mutant ER unique
      recruitment mediating the allele-specific transcriptional program. Genetic
      screens identified genes that are essential for the ligand-independent growth
      driven by the mutants. These studies provide insights into the mechanism of
      endocrine therapy resistance engendered by ER mutations and potential therapeutic
      targets.

AB  - Post-translational modifications of the transcription elongation complex provide 
      mechanisms to fine-tune gene expression, yet their specific impacts on RNA
      polymerase II regulation remain difficult to ascertain. Here, in
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we examine the role of Cdk9, and related Mcs6/Cdk7 and
      Lsk1/Cdk12 kinases, on transcription at base-pair resolution with Precision
      Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). Within a minute of Cdk9 inhibition, phosphorylation 
      of Pol II-associated factor, Spt5 is undetectable. The effects of Cdk9 inhibition
      are more severe than inhibition of Cdk7 and Cdk12, resulting in a shift of Pol II
      toward the transcription start site (TSS). A time course of Cdk9 inhibition
      reveals that early transcribing Pol II can escape promoter-proximal regions, but 
      with a severely reduced elongation rate of only ~400 bp/min. Our results in
      fission yeast suggest the existence of a conserved global regulatory checkpoint
      that requires Cdk9 kinase activity.

TI  - High MITF Expression Is Associated with Super-Enhancers and Suppressed by CDK7
      Inhibition in Melanoma.

LID - 10.1016/j.jid.2017.09.056 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive tumor that accounts for most skin cancer
      deaths. Among the physiological barriers against therapeutic success is a strong 
      survival program driven by genes such as MITF that specify melanocyte identity, a
      phenomenon known in melanoma biology as lineage dependency. MITF overexpression
      is occasionally explained by gene amplification, but here we show that
      super-enhancers are also important determinants of MITF overexpression in some
      melanoma cell lines and tumors. Although compounds that directly inhibit MITF are
      unavailable, a covalent CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, has recently been shown to potently
      suppress the growth of various cancers through the depletion of master
      transcription-regulating oncogenes and the disruption of their attendant
      super-enhancers. We also show that melanoma cells are highly sensitive to CDK7
      inhibition both in vitro and in vivo and that THZ1 can dismantle the
      super-enhancer apparatus at MITF and SOX10 in some cell lines, thereby
      extinguishing their intracellular levels. Our results show a dimension to MITF
      regulation in melanoma cells and point to CDK7 inhibition as a potential strategy
      to deprive oncogenic transcription and suppress tumor growth in melanoma.

TI  - The Orphan Nuclear Receptor Liver Homolog Receptor-1 (Nr5a2) Regulates Ovarian
      Granulosa Cell Proliferation.
PG  - 24-41
LID - 10.1210/js.2017-00329 [doi]
AB  - In mouse ovaries, liver receptor homolog-1 [nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group
      A, member 2 (Nr5a2)] expression is restricted to granulosa cells. Mice with Nr5a2
      depletion in this cell population fail to ovulate. To determine whether Nr5a2 is 
      essential for granulosa cell proliferation during follicular maturation, we
      generated granulosa-specific conditional knockout mice (genotype Nr5a2 floxed
      Cre-recombinase driven by the anti-Mullerian type II receptor, hereafter cKO)
      with Nr5a2 depletion from primary follicles forward. Proliferation in cKO
      granulosa cells was substantially reduced relative to control (CON) counterparts,
      as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, proliferative cell nuclear
      antigen expression, and fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Microarray analysis
      revealed >2000 differentially regulated transcripts between cKO and CON granulosa
      cells. Major gene ontology pathways disrupted were proliferation, steroid
      biosynthesis, female gamete formation, and ovulatory cycle. Transcripts for key
      cell-cycle genes, including Ccnd1, Ccnd2, Ccne1, Ccne2, E2f1, and E2f2, were in
      reduced abundance. Transcripts from other cell-cycle-related factors, including
      Cdh2, Plagl1, Cdkn1a, Prkar2b, Gstm1, Cdk7, and Pts, were overexpressed. Although
      the follicle-stimulating hormone and estrogen receptors were overexpressed in the
      cKO animals, in vivo treatment with estradiol-17beta failed to rescue decreased
      proliferation. In vitro inactivation of Nr5a2 using the ML180 reverse agonist
      similarly decreased cell-cycle-related gene transcripts and downstream targets,
      as in cKO mice. Pharmacological inhibition of beta-catenin, an Nr5a2 cofactor,
      decreased cyclin gene transcripts and downstream targets. Terminal
      deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling 
      immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction of
      pro/antiapoptotic and autophagic markers showed no differences between cKO and
      CON granulosa cells. Thus, Nr5a2 is essential for granulosa cell proliferation,
      but its depletion does not alter the frequency of apoptosis nor autophagy.

TI  - Mms19 is a mitotic gene that permits Cdk7 to be fully active as a Cdk-activating 
      kinase.
LID - dev156802 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/dev.156802 [doi]
AB  - Mms19 encodes a cytosolic iron-sulphur assembly component. We found that
      Drosophila Mms19 is also essential for mitotic divisions and for the
      proliferation of diploid cells. Reduced Mms19 activity causes severe mitotic
      defects in spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation, and loss of zygotic Mms19
      prevents the formation of imaginal discs. The lack of mitotic tissue in
      Mms19(P/P) larvae can be rescued by overexpression of the Cdk-activating kinase
      (CAK) complex, an activator of mitotic Cdk1, suggesting that Mms19 functions in
      mitosis to allow CAK (Cdk7/Cyclin H/Mat1) to become fully active as a
      Cdk1-activating kinase. When bound to Xpd and TFIIH, the CAK subunit Cdk7
      phosphorylates transcriptional targets and not cell cycle Cdks. In contrast, free
      CAK phosphorylates and activates Cdk1. Physical and genetic interaction studies
      between Mms19 and Xpd suggest that their interaction prevents Xpd from binding to
      the CAK complex. Xpd bound to Mms19 therefore frees CAK complexes, allowing them 
      to phosphorylate Cdk1 and facilitating progression to metaphase. The structural
      basis for the competitive interaction with Xpd seems to be the binding of Mms19, 
      core TFIIH and CAK to neighbouring or overlapping regions of Xpd.

AB  - Many cancer types are driven by oncogenic transcription factors that have been
      difficult to drug. Transcriptional inhibitors, however, may offer inroads into
      targeting these cancers. Through chemical genomics screening, we identified that 
      Ewing sarcoma is a disease with preferential sensitivity to THZ1, a covalent
      small-molecule CDK7/12/13 inhibitor. The selective CDK12/13 inhibitor, THZ531,
      impairs DNA damage repair in an EWS/FLI-dependent manner, supporting a synthetic 
      lethal relationship between response to THZ1/THZ531 and EWS/FLI expression. The
      combination of these molecules with PARP inhibitors showed striking synergy in
      cell viability and DNA damage assays in vitro and in multiple models of Ewing
      sarcoma, including a PDX, in vivo without hematopoietic toxicity.

TI  - Garcinone C exerts antitumor activity by modulating the expression of
      ATR/Stat3/4EBP1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.
PG  - 1485-1493
LID - 10.3892/or.2018.6218 [doi]
AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common head and neck
      malignancies and is typically treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
      Garcinone C, a natural compound isolated from Garcinia oblongifolia Champ., is a 
      xanthone derivative with potential cytotoxic effects on certain cancers. However,
      there are limited studies regarding its effects on NPC cells, and its mechanism
      of action in NPC remains unknown. In the present study, we found that garcinone C
      significantly inhibited cell viability of the human NPC cell lines CNE1, CNE2,
      HK1 and HONE1. This inhibition was exerted in a time and dosedependent manner.
      Flow cytometry demonstrated that garcinone C arrested the cell cycle at the S
      phase. Moreover, with 10 microM of highdose garcinone C treatment, the cells
      exhibited necrotic morphology changes including cell swelling, rough endoplasmic 
      reticulum degranulation, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, mitochondrial swelling
      and vacuolar degeneration. In addition, we found that garcinone C stimulated the 
      expression levels of ATR and 4EBP1, while efficiently inhibiting the expression
      levels of cyclin B1, cyclin D1, cyclin E2, cdc2, CDK7 and Stat3. Collectively,
      the ability of garcinone C to inhibit NPC in growth in vitro suggested that
      garcinone C may be a novel agent for the management of NPC.

TI  - ER Stress Signaling Promotes the Survival of Cancer "Persister Cells" Tolerant to
      EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.
PG  - 1044-1057
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-1904 [doi]
AB  - An increasingly recognized component of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
      (TKI) involves persistence of a drug-tolerant subpopulation of cancer cells that 
      survive despite effective eradication of the majority of the cell population.
      Multiple groups have demonstrated that these drug-tolerant persister cells
      undergo transcriptional adaptation via an epigenetic state change that promotes
      cell survival. Because this mode of TKI drug tolerance appears to involve
      transcriptional addiction to specific genes and pathways, we hypothesized that
      systematic functional screening of EGFR TKI/transcriptional inhibitor combination
      therapy would yield important mechanistic insights and alternative drug escape
      pathways. We therefore performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 enhancer/suppressor
      screen in EGFR-dependent lung cancer PC9 cells treated with erlotinib + THZ1
      (CDK7/12 inhibitor) combination therapy, a combination previously shown to
      suppress drug-tolerant cells in this setting. As expected, suppression of
      multiple genes associated with transcriptional complexes (EP300, CREBBP, and
      MED1) enhanced erlotinib/THZ1 synergy. Unexpectedly, we uncovered nearly every
      component of the recently described ufmylation pathway in the synergy suppressor 
      group. Loss of ufmylation did not affect canonical downstream EGFR signaling.
      Instead, absence of this pathway triggered a protective unfolded protein response
      associated with STING upregulation, promoting protumorigenic inflammatory
      signaling but also unique dependence on Bcl-xL. These data reveal that
      dysregulation of ufmylation and ER stress comprise a previously unrecognized TKI 
      drug tolerance pathway that engages survival signaling, with potentially
      important therapeutic implications.Significance: These findings reveal a novel
      function of the recently described ufmylation pathway, an ER stress survival
      signaling in drug-tolerant persister cells, which has important biological and
      therapeutic implications. Cancer Res; 78(4); 1044-57. (c)2017 AACR.

      cancer.
PG  - 96506-96521
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.21787 [doi]
AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which comprises approximately 15% of all
      primary breast cancer diagnoses, lacks estrogen receptor alpha, progesterone
      receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression. However, we,
      and others, have demonstrated that approximately 30% of TNBCs express estrogen
      receptor beta (ERbeta), a nuclear hormone receptor and potential drug target.
      Treatment of ERbeta expressing MDA-MB-231 cells with estrogen or the ERbeta
      selective agonist, LY500307, was shown to result in suppression of cell
      proliferation. This inhibitory effect was due to blockade of cell cycle
      progression. In vivo, estrogen treatment significantly repressed the growth of
      ERbeta expressing MDA-MB-231 cell line xenografts. Gene expression studies and
      ingenuity pathway analysis identified a network of ERbeta down-regulated genes
      involved in cell cycle progression including CDK1, cyclin B and cyclin H. siRNA
      mediated knockdown or drug inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 in TNBC cells resulted in 
      substantial decreases in proliferation regardless of ERbeta expression. These
      data suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of ERbeta in TNBC result from
      inhibition of cell cycle progression, effects that are in part mediated by
      suppression of CDK1/7. Furthermore, these data indicate that blockade of CDK1/7
      activity in TNBC may be of therapeutic benefit, an area of study that has yet to 
      be explored.

TI  - Cdk7 Is Required for Activity-Dependent Neuronal Gene Expression, Long-Lasting
      Synaptic Plasticity and Long-Term Memory.
PG  - 365
LID - 10.3389/fnmol.2017.00365 [doi]
AB  - In the brain, de novo gene expression driven by learning-associated neuronal
      activities is critical for the formation of long-term memories. However, the
      signaling machinery mediating neuronal activity-induced gene expression,
      especially the rapid transcription of immediate-early genes (IEGs) remains
      unclear. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are a family of serine/threonine kinases
      that have been firmly established as key regulators of transcription processes
      underling coordinated cell cycle entry and sequential progression in nearly all
      types of proliferative cells. Cdk7 is a subunit of transcriptional initiation
      factor II-H (TFIIH) and the only known Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) in metazoans. 
      Recent studies using a novel Cdk7 specific covalent inhibitor, THZ1, revealed
      important roles of Cdk7 in transcription regulation in cancer cells. However,
      whether Cdk7 plays a role in the regulation of transcription in neurons remains
      unknown. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that, in post-mitotic
      neurons, Cdk7 activity is positively correlated with neuronal activities in
      cultured primary neurons, acute hippocampal slices and in the brain. Cdk7
      inhibition by THZ1 significantly suppressed mRNA levels of IEGs, selectively
      impaired long-lasting synaptic plasticity induced by 4 trains of high frequency
      stimulation (HFS) and prevented the formation of long-term memories.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase
      that has been shown to play important roles in many tissues except the nervous
      system. We previously reported that CDK5 showed differential expression in the
      transcriptome profiles of the skin of alpacas with different hair colors. To
      understand the functional role of CDK5 in hair color determination, we
      constructed CDK5-knockdown mice and identified the effect on the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the mouse skin. Quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction, co-immunoprecipitation, and western blotting
      were performed to analyze the effects of CDK5-knockdown on the MAPK pathway in
      mice. The results showed that MAP3K6 was inhibited by phosphorylated CDK5 through
      its activator CDK7. The decrease in MAP3K6 levels caused down-regulation of MEK1 
      and ERK expression, leading to the up-regulation of miR-143-3p, which targets
      MAP3K6 via Dicer. Taken together, our findings indicate that CDK5 functions in
      regulating the MAPK pathway. Given that MAP3K6 was inhibited in two directions,
      this mechanism can provide insight into the contributions of the MAPK/ERK pathway
      to the inhibition of melanin production.

TI  - Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator.
PG  - 204-209

AB  - For the initiation of transcription, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) assembles with
      general transcription factors on promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex 
      (PIC). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae PIC and PIC-core Mediator complex at nominal resolutions of 4.7 A and 
      5.8 A, respectively. The structures reveal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), and 
      suggest how the core and kinase TFIIH modules function in the opening of promoter
      DNA and the phosphorylation of Pol II, respectively. The TFIIH core subunit Ssl2 
      (a homologue of human XPB) is positioned on downstream DNA by the 'E-bridge'
      helix in TFIIE, consistent with TFIIE-stimulated DNA opening. The TFIIH kinase
      module subunit Tfb3 (MAT1 in human) anchors the kinase Kin28 (CDK7), which is
      mobile in the PIC but preferentially located between the Mediator hook and
      shoulder in the PIC-core Mediator complex. Open spaces between the Mediator head 
      and middle modules may allow access of the kinase to its substrate, the
      C-terminal domain of Pol II.

TI  - CDK7 inhibition suppresses rheumatoid arthritis inflammation via blockage of
      NF-kappaB activation and IL-1beta/IL-6 secretion.
PG  - 1292-1301
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13414 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by
      joint swelling, joint tenderness and destruction of synovial joints, leading to
      severe disability. Anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
      drugs (DMARDs) may improve RA process. However, in most patients the treatment
      effect is still not satisfactory. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) plays a
      well-established role in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell division cycle,
      and recent studies indicated that it exerted anti-inflammatory effect. In our
      previous research, we found that inhibition of CDK7 by highly selective inhibitor
      BS-181 significantly impeded the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
      mice. However, the underlying mechanism of CDK7 in RA remains to be explored. We 
      elucidated the molecular mechanism of CDK7 inhibition in RA inflammation by
      administration of CDK7 highly selective inhibitor BS-181 and siRNA-CDK7. We found
      that both IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and RANKL transcript levels and IL-1beta/IL-6
      secretion were effectively suppressed by BS-181 treatment as well as CDK7
      knockdown. Furthermore, CDK7 inhibition prevented NF-kappaB signalling pathway
      activation and restrained p65 nuclear translocation. Moreover, CDK7 selective
      inhibitor BS-181 also blocked phosphorylation of p65 in MH7A cells. These results
      strongly indicate that CDK7 inhibition by BS-181 and siRNA-CDK7 significantly
      suppresses rheumatoid arthritis inflammation, which may be via blockage of
      NF-kappaB signalling pathway and IL-1beta/IL-6 secretion.

AB  - Acquired drug resistance is a major factor limiting the effectiveness of targeted
      cancer therapies. Targeting tumors with kinase inhibitors induces complex
      adaptive programs that promote the persistence of a fraction of the original cell
      population, facilitating the eventual outgrowth of inhibitor-resistant tumor
      clones. We show that the addition of a newly identified CDK7/12 inhibitor, THZ1, 
      to targeted therapy enhances cell killing and impedes the emergence of
      drug-resistant cell populations in diverse cellular and in vivo cancer models. We
      propose that targeted therapy induces a state of transcriptional dependency in a 
      subpopulation of cells poised to become drug tolerant, which THZ1 can exploit by 
      blocking dynamic transcriptional responses, promoting remodeling of enhancers and
      key signaling outputs required for tumor cell survival in the setting of targeted
      therapy. These findings suggest that the addition of THZ1 to targeted therapies
      is a promising broad-based strategy to hinder the emergence of drug-resistant
      cancer cell populations.Significance: CDK7/12 inhibition prevents active enhancer
      formation at genes, promoting resistance emergence in response to targeted
      therapy, and impedes the engagement of transcriptional programs required for
      tumor cell survival. CDK7/12 inhibition in combination with targeted cancer
      therapies may serve as a therapeutic paradigm for enhancing the effectiveness of 
      targeted therapies. Cancer Discov; 8(1); 59-73. (c)2017 AACR.See related

TI  - Activation of the p53 Transcriptional Program Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Cdk7
      Inhibitors.

AB  - Cdk7, the CDK-activating kinase and transcription factor IIH component, is a
      target of inhibitors that kill cancer cells by exploiting tumor-specific
      transcriptional dependencies. However, whereas selective inhibition of
      analog-sensitive (AS) Cdk7 in colon cancer-derived cells arrests division and
      disrupts transcription, it does not by itself trigger apoptosis efficiently.
      Here, we show that p53 activation by 5-fluorouracil or nutlin-3 synergizes with a
      reversible Cdk7(as) inhibitor to induce cell death. Synthetic lethality was
      recapitulated with covalent inhibitors of wild-type Cdk7, THZ1, or the more
      selective YKL-1-116. The effects were allele specific; a CDK7(as) mutation
      conferred both sensitivity to bulky adenine analogs and resistance to covalent
      inhibitors. Non-transformed colon epithelial cells were resistant to these
      combinations, as were cancer-derived cells with p53-inactivating mutations.
      Apoptosis was dependent on death receptor DR5, a p53 transcriptional target whose
      expression was refractory to Cdk7 inhibition. Therefore, p53 activation induces
      transcriptional dependency to sensitize cancer cells to Cdk7 inhibition.

TI  - Enhancer profiling identifies critical cancer genes and characterizes cell
      identity in adult T-cell leukemia.
PG  - 2326-2338
LID - 10.1182/blood-2017-06-792184 [doi]
AB  - A number of studies have recently demonstrated that super-enhancers, which are
      large cluster of enhancers typically marked by a high level of acetylation of
      histone H3 lysine 27 and mediator bindings, are frequently associated with genes 
      that control and define cell identity during normal development. Super-enhancers 
      are also often enriched at cancer genes in various malignancies. The
      identification of such enhancers would pinpoint critical factors that directly
      contribute to pathogenesis. In this study, we performed enhancer profiling using 
      primary leukemia samples from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which is a
      genetically heterogeneous intractable cancer. Super-enhancers were enriched at
      genes involved in the T-cell activation pathway, including IL2RA/CD25, CD30, and 
      FYN, in both ATL and normal mature T cells, which reflected the origin of the
      leukemic cells. Super-enhancers were found at several known cancer gene loci,
      including CCR4, PIK3R1, and TP73, in multiple ATL samples, but not in normal
      mature T cells, which implicated those genes in ATL pathogenesis. A
      small-molecule CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, efficiently inhibited cell growth, induced
      apoptosis, and downregulated the expression of super-enhancer-associated genes in
      ATL cells. Furthermore, enhancer profiling combined with gene expression analysis
      identified a previously uncharacterized gene, TIAM2, that was associated with
      super-enhancers in all ATL samples, but not in normal T cells. Knockdown of TIAM2
      induced apoptosis in ATL cell lines, whereas overexpression of this gene promoted
      cell growth. Our study provides a novel strategy for identifying critical cancer 
      genes.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an invasive cancer with particularly high
      incidence in Southeast Asia and Southern China. The pathogenic mechanisms of NPC,
      particularly those involving epigenetic dysregulation, remain largely elusive,
      hampering clinical management of this malignancy. To identify novel druggable
      targets, we carried out an unbiased high-throughput chemical screening and
      observed that NPC cells were highly sensitive to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent
      kinases (CDK), especially THZ1, a covalent inhibitor of CDK7. THZ1 demonstrated
      pronounced antineoplastic activities both in vitro and in vivo An integrative
      analysis using both whole-transcriptome sequencing and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing pinpointed oncogenic transcriptional amplification
      mediated by super-enhancers (SE) as a key mechanism underlying the vulnerability 
      of NPC cells to THZ1 treatment. Further characterization of SE-mediated networks 
      identified many novel SE-associated oncogenic transcripts, such as BCAR1, F3,
      LDLR, TBC1D2, and the long noncoding RNA TP53TG1. These transcripts were highly
      and specifically expressed in NPC and functionally promoted NPC malignant
      phenotypes. Moreover, DNA-binding motif analysis within the SE segments suggest
      that several transcription factors (including ETS2, MAFK, and TEAD1) may help
      establish and maintain SE activity across the genome. Taken together, our data
      establish the landscape of SE-associated oncogenic transcriptional network in
      NPC, which can be exploited for the development of more effective therapeutic
      regimens for this disease. Cancer Res; 77(23); 6614-26. (c)2017 AACR.

TI  - Prognostic value of DNA repair genes based on stratification of glioblastomas.
PG  - 58222-58230
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.17452 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal expression of DNA repair genes is frequently associated with
      cancerogenesis of many tumors, however, the role DNA repair genes play in the
      progression of glioblastoma remains unclear. In this study, taking advantage of
      large scale of RNA-seq data, as well as clinical data, the function and prognosis
      value of key DNA repair genes in glioblastoma were analyzed by systematically
      bioinformatic approaches. Clustering was performed to screen potentially abnormal
      DNA repair genes related to the prognosis of glioblastoma, followed by
      unsupervised clustering to identify molecular subtypes of glioblastomas.
      Characteristics and prognosis differences were analyzed among these molecular
      subtypes, and modular driver genes in molecular subtypes were identified based on
      changes in expression correlation. Multifactor Cox proportional hazard analysis
      was used to find the independent prognostic factor. A total of 15 key genes,
      which were significantly related to prognosis, were identified and four molecular
      subtypes of disease were obtained through unsupervised clustering, based on these
      15 genes. By analyzing the clinical features of these 4 molecular subtypes,
      Cluster 4 was found to be different from others in terms of age and prognosis
      level. A total of 5 key DNA repair genes, CDK7, DDB2, RNH1, RFC2 and FAH, were
      screened to be significantly related to the prognosis of glioblastomas (p =
      9.74e(-05)). In summary, the DNA repair genes which can predict the prognosis of 
      patients with Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were identified and validated. The
      expression level of DNA repair genes shows the potential of predicting the
      prognosis and therapy design in targeting GBM.

AB  - Sexual dimorphism in prenatal development is widespread among vertebrates,
      including birds. Its mechanism remains unclear, although it has been attributed
      to the effect of maternal steroid hormones. The aim of this study was to
      investigate how increased levels of steroid hormones in the eggs influence early 
      embryonic development of male and female offspring. We also asked whether
      maternal hormones take part in the control of sex-specific expression of the
      genes involved in prenatal development. We experimentally manipulated hormones'
      concentrations in the egg yolk by injecting zebra finch females prior to
      ovulation with testosterone or corticosterone. We assessed growth rate and
      expression levels of CDK7, FBP1 and GHR genes in 37h-old embryos. We found faster
      growth and higher expression of two studied genes in male compared to female
      embryos. Hormonal treatment, despite clearly differentiating egg steroid levels, 
      had no effect on the sex-specific pattern of the embryonic gene expression, even 
      though we confirmed expression of receptors of androgens and glucocorticoids at
      such an early stage of development. Thus, our study shows high stability of the
      early sex differences in the embryonic development before the onset of sexual
      differentiation and indicates their independence of maternal hormones in the egg.

AB  - In mammals, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are involved in regulating both the
      cell cycle and transcription. Although CDK1 is known to act as the kinase subunit
      of maturation-promoting factor (MPF), the roles of the other CDKs in mammalian
      oocyte maturation are not yet understood. Here, we show that inhibition of
      various CDKs by small molecule inhibitors has different effects on the maturation
      and transcriptional activity of pig oocytes in vitro. Inhibition of CDK1 did not 
      significantly affect cumulus cell expansion, but its kinase activity was
      necessary for germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). The inhibitions of CDK2, CDK4,
      or CDK6 had no effect on cumulus expansion or GVBD. The catalytic activity of
      CDK7 was crucial for GVBD but less important for cumulus expansion, whereas
      inhibition of CDK9 severely blocked both cumulus cell expansion and GVBD. CDK1,
      -2, -4, and -6 appeared to be dispensable for nuclear transcription, as their
      inhibitions did not affect nascent RNA production in oocytes. However, inhibition
      of CDK7 or CDK9 dramatically decreased the transcriptional activity in oocytes.
      Finally, we found that the GVBD arrest triggered by CDK9 inhibition was not due
      to altered MPF activity, but rather the inhibition of transcription. Overall, our
      results show that CDK7 and CDK9 are important for the nuclear maturation and
      transcriptional activity of pig oocytes.

TI  - The cryo-electron microscopy structure of human transcription factor IIH.
PG  - 414-417

AB  - Human transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is part of the general transcriptional
      machinery required by RNA polymerase II for the initiation of eukaryotic gene
      transcription. Composed of ten subunits that add up to a molecular mass of about 
      500 kDa, TFIIH is also essential for nucleotide excision repair. The
      seven-subunit TFIIH core complex formed by XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, p34, and p8
      is competent for DNA repair, while the CDK-activating kinase subcomplex, which
      includes the kinase activity of CDK7 as well as the cyclin H and MAT1 subunits,
      is additionally required for transcription initiation. Mutations in the TFIIH
      subunits XPB, XPD, and p8 lead to severe premature ageing and cancer propensity
      in the genetic diseases xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and
      trichothiodystrophy, highlighting the importance of TFIIH for cellular
      physiology. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TFIIH
      at 4.4 A resolution. The structure reveals the molecular architecture of the
      TFIIH core complex, the detailed structures of its constituent XPB and XPD
      ATPases, and how the core and kinase subcomplexes of TFIIH are connected.
      Additionally, our structure provides insight into the conformational dynamics of 
      TFIIH and the regulation of its activity.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of an irinotecan
      derivative, ZBH1208, on brain tumors, and to explore the underlying molecular
      mechanisms. To determine the effects of ZBH1208, a brain tumor mouse model was
      established by transplanting B22 cells. Subsequently, the visceral indices of
      immune organs and white blood cell counts were determined, and the effects of
      ZBH1208 on the expression levels of cell cyclerelated proteins were assessed by
      western blotting. The tumor inhibition rates of 20 and 40 mg/kg ZBH1208 were 11.7
      and 54.1%, respectively. Compared with the negative control group, ZBH1208 barely
      affected visceral indices or white blood cell count. Furthermore, the expression 
      levels of p53, p21, cyclindependent kinase 7 (CDK7), Wee1, phosphorylated (p)cell
      division cycle 2 (CDC2) (Tyr15), pCDC2 (Thr161) and cyclin B1 proteins were
      upregulated, whereas the expression levels of cyclin E were downregulated, and
      those of CDC2, CDK2 and CDC25C were barely altered. In conclusion, the present
      study demonstrated that ZBH1208 suppressed the growth of B22 mouse brain tumor
      xenografts, but did not affect their visceral indices or white blood cell counts.
      It was suggested that ZBH1208 exerted its effects by regulating the expression of
      p53, p21, Wee1, pCDC2 (Tyr15) and cyclin E proteins.

PG  - 47-51
LID - 10.1080/21541264.2017.1331723 [doi]
AB  - TFIIH is a 10-subunit complex involved in transcription and DNA repair. It
      contains several enzymatic activities including a ATP-dependent DNA translocase
      in XPB and a cyclin-dependent kinase in CDK7. Recently the discovery of several
      XPB and CDK7 inhibitors with specific impact on the transcriptional addiction of 
      many tumors pinpointed these activities as potential target in cancer
      chemotherapy. Unexpectedly a basal transcription factor involved in global mRNA
      expression now emerges a one of the most clinically promising Achilles heels of
      cancerous cells. These inhibitors also proved to be useful tools to unveil new
      functions of TFIIH in gene expression.

AB  - CDK7 phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II (pol II) C-terminal domain CTD and
      activates the P-TEFb-associated kinase CDK9, but its regulatory roles remain
      obscure. Here, using human CDK7 analog-sensitive (CDK7as) cells, we observed
      reduced capping enzyme recruitment, increased pol II promoter-proximal pausing,
      and defective termination at gene 3' ends upon CDK7 inhibition. We also noted
      that CDK7 regulates chromatin modifications downstream of transcription start
      sites. H3K4me3 spreading was restricted at gene 5' ends and H3K36me3 was
      displaced toward gene 3' ends in CDK7as cells. Mass spectrometry identified
      factors that bound TFIIH-phosphorylated versus P-TEFb-phosphorylated CTD (versus 
      unmodified); capping enzymes and H3K4 methyltransferase complexes, SETD1A/B,
      selectively bound phosphorylated CTD, and the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2
      specifically bound P-TEFb-phosphorylated CTD. Moreover, TFIIH-phosphorylated CTD 
      stimulated SETD1A/B activity toward nucleosomes, revealing a mechanistic basis
      for CDK7 regulation of H3K4me3 spreading. Collectively, these results implicate a
      CDK7-dependent "CTD code" that regulates chromatin marks in addition to RNA
      processing and pol II pausing.

      Enzalutamide Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.

LID - 10.7150/thno.17852 [doi]
AB  - Enzalutamide is a second-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist for the
      treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
      Unfortunately, AR dysfunction means that resistance to enzalutamide will
      eventually develop. Thus, novel agents are urgently needed to treat this
      devastating disease. Triptolide (TPL), a key active compound extracted from the
      Chinese herb Thunder God Vine (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.), possesses
      anti-cancer activity in human prostate cancer cells. However, the effects of TPL 
      against CRPC cells and the underlying mechanism of any such effect are unknown.
      In this study, we found that TPL at low dose inhibits the transactivation
      activity of both full-length and truncated AR without changing their protein
      levels. Interestingly, TPL inhibits phosphorylation of AR and its CRPC-associated
      variant AR-V7 at Ser515 through XPB/CDK7. As a result, TPL suppresses the binding
      of AR to promoter regions in AR target genes along with reduced TFIIH and RNA Pol
      II recruitment. Moreover, TPL at low dose reduces the viability of prostate
      cancer cells expressing AR or AR-Vs. Low-dose TPL also shows a synergistic effect
      with enzalutamide to inhibit CRPC cell survival in vitro, and enhances the
      anti-cancer effect of enzalutamide on CRPC xenografts with minimal side effects. 
      Taken together, our data demonstrate that TPL targets the transactivation
      activity of both full-length and truncated ARs. Our results also suggest that TPL
      is a potential drug for CRPC, and can be used in combination with enzalutamide to
      treat CRPC.

      Transcriptional Addiction in Ovarian Cancer.

AB  - Ovarian cancer remains a significant cause of gynecologic cancer mortality, and
      novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed in clinic as new treatment
      options. We previously showed that BET bromodomain inhibitors displayed promising
      efficacy for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer by downregulating pivot
      transcription factors. However, the potential antitumor activities and molecular 
      mechanisms of other epigenetic or transcriptional therapies have not been
      systematically determined. Here, by performing an unbiased high-throughput drug
      screen to identify candidate compounds with antineoplastic effects, we identified
      THZ1, a recently developed covalent CDK7 inhibitor, as a new
      transcription-targeting compound that exerted broad cytotoxicity against ovarian 
      tumors. Mechanistically, CDK7 represented a previously unappreciated actionable
      vulnerability in ovarian cancer, and CDK7 inhibition led to a pronounced
      dysregulation of gene transcription, with a preferential repression of
      E2F-regulated genes and transcripts associated with super-enhancers. Our findings
      revealed the molecular underpinnings of THZ1 potency and established
      pharmaceutically targeting transcriptional addiction as a promising therapeutic
      strategy in aggressive ovarian cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(9); 1739-50. (c)2017

TI  - Site-specific regulation of histone H1 phosphorylation in pluripotent cell
      differentiation.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s13072-017-0135-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural variation among histone H1 variants confers distinct modes
      of chromatin binding that are important for differential regulation of chromatin 
      condensation, gene expression and other processes. Changes in the expression and 
      genomic distributions of H1 variants during cell differentiation appear to
      contribute to phenotypic differences between cell types, but few details are
      known about the roles of individual H1 variants and the significance of their
      disparate capacities for phosphorylation. In this study, we investigated the
      dynamics of interphase phosphorylation at specific sites in individual H1
      variants during the differentiation of pluripotent NT2 and mouse embryonic stem
      cells and characterized the kinases involved in regulating specific H1 variant
      phosphorylations in NT2 and HeLa cells. RESULTS: Here, we show that the global
      levels of phosphorylation at H1.5-Ser18 (pS18-H1.5), H1.2/H1.5-Ser173
      (pS173-H1.2/5) and H1.4-Ser187 (pS187-H1.4) are regulated differentially during
      pluripotent cell differentiation. Enrichment of pS187-H1.4 near the transcription
      start site of pluripotency factor genes in pluripotent cells is markedly reduced 
      upon differentiation, whereas pS187-H1.4 levels at housekeeping genes are largely
      unaltered. Selective inhibition of CDK7 or CDK9 rapidly diminishes pS187-H1.4
      levels globally and its enrichment at housekeeping genes, and similar responses
      were observed following depletion of CDK9. These data suggest that H1.4-S187 is a
      bona fide substrate for CDK9, a notion that is further supported by the
      significant colocalization of CDK9 and pS187-H1.4 to gene promoters in reciprocal
      re-ChIP analyses. Moreover, treating cells with actinomycin D to inhibit
      transcription and trigger the release of active CDK9/P-TEFb from 7SK snRNA
      complexes induces the accumulation of pS187-H1.4 at promoters and gene bodies.
      Notably, the levels of pS187-H1.4 enrichment after actinomycin D treatment or
      cell differentiation reflect the extent of CDK9 recruitment at the same loci.
      Remarkably, the global levels of H1.5-S18 and H1.2/H1.5-S173 phosphorylation are 
      not affected by these transcription inhibitor treatments, and selective
      inhibition of CDK2 does not affect the global levels of phosphorylation at
      H1.4-S187 or H1.5-S18. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide strong evidence that H1
      variant interphase phosphorylation is dynamically regulated in a site-specific
      and gene-specific fashion during pluripotent cell differentiation, and that
      enrichment of pS187-H1.4 at genes is positively related to their transcription.
      H1.4-S187 is likely to be a direct target of CDK9 during interphase, suggesting
      the possibility that this particular phosphorylation may contribute to the
      release of paused RNA pol II. In contrast, the other H1 variant phosphorylations 
      we investigated appear to be mediated by distinct kinases and further analyses
      are needed to determine their functional significance.

AB  - High-grade glioma (HGG) is an incurable brain cancer. The transcriptomes of cells
      within HGG tumors are highly heterogeneous. This renders the tumors unresponsive 
      or able to adapt to therapeutics targeted at single pathways, thereby causing
      treatment failure. To overcome this, we focused on cyclin-dependent kinase 7
      (CDK7), a ubiquitously expressed molecule involved in two major drivers of HGG
      pathogenesis: cell cycle progression and RNA polymerase-II-based transcription.
      We tested the activity of THZ1, an irreversible CDK7 inhibitor, on
      patient-derived primary HGG cell lines and ex vivo HGG patient tissue slices,
      using proliferation assays, microarray analysis, high-resolution respirometry,
      cell cycle analysis and in vivo tumor orthografts. The cellular processes
      affected by CDK7 inhibition were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-quantitative
      PCR, western blot, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. THZ1 perturbed the
      transcriptome and disabled CDK activation, leading to cell cycle arrest at G2 and
      DNA damage. THZ1 halted transcription of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
      ribosomal genes, reducing mitochondrial translation and oxidative respiration. It
      also inhibited the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha
      (PDGFR-alpha), reducing signaling flux through the AKT,
      extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) downstream pathways. Finally, THZ1 disrupted
      nucleolar, Cajal body and nuclear speckle formation, resulting in reduced
      cytosolic translation and malfunction of the spliceosome and thus leading to
      aberrant mRNA processing. These findings indicate that CDK7 is crucial for
      gliomagenesis, validate CDK7 as a therapeutic target and provide new insight into
      the cellular processes that are affected by THZ1 and induce antitumor activity.

TI  - Therapeutic Rationale to Target Highly Expressed CDK7 Conferring Poor Outcomes in
      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
PG  - 3834-3845

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients commonly exhibit poor prognosis and
      high relapse after treatment, but there remains a lack of biomarkers and
      effective targeted therapies for this disease. Here, we report evidence
      highlighting the cell-cycle-related kinase CDK7 as a driver and candidate
      therapeutic target in TNBC. Using publicly available transcriptomic data from a
      collated set of TNBC patients (n = 383) and the METABRIC TNBC dataset (n = 217), 
      we found CDK7 mRNA levels to be correlated with patient prognosis. High CDK7
      protein expression was associated with poor prognosis within the RATHER TNBC
      cohort (n = 109) and the METABRIC TNBC cohort (n = 203). The highly specific CDK7
      kinase inhibitors, BS-181 and THZ1, each downregulated CDK7-mediated
      phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, indicative of transcriptional inhibition,
      with THZ1 exhibiting 500-fold greater potency than BS-181. Mechanistic
      investigations revealed that the survival of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells relied heavily
      on the BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling axes in cells. Accordingly, we found that combining
      the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors ABT-263/ABT199 with the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1
      synergized in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis of human TNBC cells.
      Collectively, our results highlight elevated CDK7 expression as a candidate
      biomarker of poor prognosis in TNBC, and they offer a preclinical proof of
      concept for combining CDK7 and BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors as a mechanism-based
      therapeutic strategy to improve TNBC treatment. Cancer Res; 77(14); 3834-45.

AB  - Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal pediatric cancer with limited 
      therapeutic options. The majority of cases of DIPG exhibit a mutation in
      histone-3 (H3K27M) that results in oncogenic transcriptional aberrancies. We show
      here that DIPG is vulnerable to transcriptional disruption using bromodomain
      inhibition or CDK7 blockade. Targeting oncogenic transcription through either of 
      these methods synergizes with HDAC inhibition, and DIPG cells resistant to HDAC
      inhibitor therapy retain sensitivity to CDK7 blockade. Identification of
      super-enhancers in DIPG provides insights toward the cell of origin, highlighting
      oligodendroglial lineage genes, and reveals unexpected mechanisms mediating tumor
      viability and invasion, including potassium channel function and EPH receptor
      signaling. The findings presented demonstrate transcriptional vulnerabilities and
      elucidate previously unknown mechanisms of DIPG pathobiology.

TI  - Essential role of endogenous prolactin and CDK7 in estrogen-induced upregulation 
      of the prolactin receptor in breast cancer cells.
PG  - 27353-27363
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.16040 [doi]
AB  - Our early studies have shown that Estradiol (E2)/Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER) in 
      a non-DNA dependent manner through complex formation with C/EBPbeta/SP1 induced
      transcriptional activation of the generic hPIII promoter and expression of the
      Prolactin Receptor (PRLR) receptor in MCF-7 cells. Subsequent studies
      demonstrated effects of unliganded ERalpha with requisite participation of
      endogenous PRL on the activation of PRLR transcription. Also, EGF/ERBB1 in the
      absence of PRL and E2 effectively induced upregulation of the PRLR. In this study
      we have delineated the transcriptional mechanism of upregulation of PRLR receptor
      induced by E2 incorporating knowledge of the various transcriptional upregulation
      modalities from our previous studies. Here, we demonstrate an essential
      requirement of STAT5a induced by PRL via PRLR receptor which associates at the
      promoter and its interaction with phoshoERalpha S118. Knock-down of PRL by siRNA 
      significantly reduced E2-induced PRLR promoter activity, mRNA and protein
      expression, recruitment of ERalpha to the complex at promoter, C/EBPbeta
      association to its DNA site and productive complex formation at hPIII promoter.
      The specific CDK7 inhibitor (THZ1) that attenuates E2-induced ERalpha
      phosphorylation at S118 abrogated E2-induced PRLR promoter activation. Further
      studies demonstrated that E2 induced cell migration was inhibited by PRL siRNA
      and THZ1 indicating its dependence on PRL/PRLR and CDK7, respectively. Our
      studies have demonstrated the essential role of endogenous PRL and CDK7 in the
      upregulation of PRLR by E2 and provide insights for therapeutic approaches that
      will mitigate the transcription/expression of PRLR and its participation in
      breast cancer progression fueled by E2 and PRL via their cognate receptors.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play vital roles in the
      development of human cancers, but our understandings of most lncRNAs in cancers
      are still limited. Recently, accumlating evidences have showed that many RNA
      transcripts could function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) by competitively
      binding common microRNAs. In this study, we demonstrated that a lncRNA, Small
      Nucleolar RNA Host Gene 1 (SNHG1), as a ceRNA for miR-199a-3p, played a critical 
      role in prostate cancer cell proliferation. We found that SNHG1 was aberrantly
      up-regulated in prostate carcinoma tissues; while, miR-199a-3p was abnormally
      down-regulated. The level of SNHG1 in prostate cancer was significantly
      negatively correlated with that of miR-199a-3p. Our data indicated that SNHG1
      could interact with miR-199a-3p and inhibit the activity of miR-199a-3p in
      prostate cancer cells. In addition, miR-199a-3p could target the 3' UTR of CDK7
      and suppress CDK7 expression. More importantly, SNHG1 increased CDK7 expression
      by competitively binding miR-199a-3p, and then promoted cell proliferation and
      cell cycle progression in prostate cancer. Taken together, these findings
      elucidated a novel mechanism of prostate cancer progression. Thus, SNHG1 might
      serve as a potential target for prostate cancer therapies.

TI  - JNKs function as CDK4-activating kinases by phosphorylating CDK4 and p21.
PG  - 4349-4361
LID - 10.1038/onc.2017.7 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin D-CDK4/6 are the first cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes to be
      activated by mitogenic/oncogenic pathways. They have a central role in the cell
      multiplication decision and in its deregulation in cancer cells. We identified
      T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 rather than cyclin D accumulation as the distinctly 
      regulated step determining CDK4 activation. This finding challenges the view that
      the only identified metazoan CDK-activating kinase, cyclin H-CDK7-Mat1 (CAK),
      which is constitutively active, is responsible for the activating phosphorylation
      of all cell cycle CDKs. We previously showed that T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 is
      conditioned by an adjacent proline (P173), which is not present in CDK6 and
      CDK1/2. Although CDK7 activity was recently shown to be required for CDK4
      activation, we proposed that proline-directed kinases might specifically initiate
      the activation of CDK4. Here, we report that JNKs, but not ERK1/2 or CAK, can be 
      direct CDK4-activating kinases for cyclin D-CDK4 complexes that are inactivated
      by p21-mediated stabilization. JNKs and ERK1/2 also phosphorylated p21 at S130
      and T57, which might facilitate CDK7-dependent activation of p21-bound CDK4,
      however, mutation of these sites did not impair the phosphorylation of CDK4 by
      JNKs. In two selected tumor cells, two different JNK inhibitors inhibited the
      phosphorylation and activation of cyclin D1-CDK4-p21 but not the activation of
      cyclin D3-CDK4 that is mainly associated to p27. Specific inhibition by chemical 
      genetics in MEFs confirmed the involvement of JNK2 in cyclin D1-CDK4 activation. 
      Therefore, JNKs could be activating kinases for cyclin D1-CDK4 bound to p21, by
      independently phosphorylating both CDK4 and p21.

AB  - Our understanding of the molecular determinants of cancer is still inadequate
      because of cancer heterogeneity. Here, using epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) as a
      model system, we analyzed a minute amount of patient-derived epithelial cells
      from either healthy or cancerous tissues by single-shot mass-spectrometry-based
      phosphoproteomics. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we demonstrated that
      primary cells recapitulate tissue complexity and represent a valuable source of
      differentially expressed proteins and phosphorylation sites that discriminate
      cancer from healthy cells. Furthermore, we uncovered kinase signatures associated
      with EOC. In particular, CDK7 targets were characterized in both EOC primary
      cells and ovarian cancer cell lines. We showed that CDK7 controls cell
      proliferation and that pharmacological inhibition of CDK7 selectively represses
      EOC cell proliferation. Our approach defines the molecular landscape of EOC,
      paving the way for efficient therapeutic approaches for patients. Finally, we
      highlight the potential of phosphoproteomics to identify clinically relevant and 
      druggable pathways in cancer.

AB  - The more than 500 protein kinases comprising the human kinome catalyze hundreds
      of thousands of phosphorylation events to regulate a diversity of cellular
      functions; however, the extended substrate specificity is still unknown for many 
      of these kinases. We report here a method for quantitatively describing kinase
      substrate specificity using an unbiased peptide library-based approach with
      direct measurement of phosphorylation by tandem liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) peptide sequencing (multiplex substrate profiling by mass
      spectrometry, MSP-MS). This method can be deployed with as low as 10 nM enzyme to
      determine activity against S/T/Y-containing peptides; additionally, label-free
      quantitation is used to ascertain catalytic efficiency values for individual
      peptide substrates in the multiplex assay. Using this approach we developed
      quantitative motifs for a selection of kinases from each branch of the kinome,
      with and without known substrates, highlighting the applicability of the method. 
      The sensitivity of this approach is evidenced by its ability to detect
      phosphorylation events from nanogram quantities of immunoprecipitated material,
      which allows for wider applicability of this method. To increase the information 
      content of the quantitative kinase motifs, a sublibrary approach was used to
      expand the testable sequence space within a peptide library of approximately 100 
      members for CDK1, CDK7, and CDK9. Kinetic analysis of the HIV-1 Tat
      (transactivator of transcription)-positive transcription elongation factor b
      (P-TEFb) interaction allowed for localization of the P-TEFb phosphorylation site 
      as well as characterization of the stimulatory effect of Tat on P-TEFb catalytic 
      efficiency.

AB  - At least some animal species can generate neurons from mesoderm or endoderm, but 
      the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We screened for C. elegans mutants in
      which the presumptive mesoderm-derived I4 neuron adopts a muscle-like cell fate. 
      From this screen, we identified HLH-3, the C. elegans homolog of a mammalian
      proneural protein (Ascl1) used for in vitro neuronal reprogramming, as required
      for efficient I4 neurogenesis. We discovered that the CDK-8 Mediator kinase
      module acts together with a second proneural protein, HLH-2, and in parallel to
      HLH-3 to promote I4 neurogenesis. Genetic analysis revealed that CDK-8 most
      likely promotes I4 neurogenesis by inhibiting the CDK-7/CYH-1 (CDK7/cyclin H)
      kinase module of the transcription initiation factor TFIIH. Ectopic expression of
      HLH-2 and HLH-3 together promoted expression of neuronal features in non-neuronal
      cells. These findings reveal that the Mediator CDK8 kinase module can promote
      non-ectodermal neurogenesis and suggest that inhibiting CDK7/cyclin H might
      similarly promote neurogenesis.

PG  - 38

AB  - Curcuma longa has long been used in China and India as anti-inflammatory agent to
      treat a wide variety of conditions and also as a spice for varied curry
      preparations. The chemoprofile of the Curcuma species exhibits the presence of
      varied phytochemicals with curcumin being present in all three species but AA
      only being shown in C. longa. This study explored the effect of a curcumin/AA
      combination on human cancer cell lines. The curcumin/AA combination was assessed 
      by isobologram analysis using the Loewe additivity drug interaction model. The
      drug combination showed additive cytotoxicity toward CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000
      leukemia cell lines and HCT116p53(+/+) and HCT116p53(-/-) colon cancer cell line,
      while the glioblastoma cell lines U87MG and U87MG.DeltaEGFR showed additive to
      supra-additive cytotoxicity. Gene expression profiles predicting sensitivity and 
      resistance of tumor cells to induction by curcumin and AA were determined by
      microarray-based mRNA expressions, COMPARE, and hierarchical cluster analyses.
      Numerous genes involved in transcription (TFAM, TCERG1, RGS13, C11orf31),
      apoptosis-regulation (CRADD, CDK7, CDK19, CD81, TOM1) signal transduction (NR1D2,
      HMGN1, ABCA1, DE4ND4B, TRIM27) DNA repair (TOPBP1, RPA2), mRNA metabolism (RBBP4,
      HNRNPR, SRSF4, NR2F2, PDK1, TGM2), and transporter genes (ABCA1) correlated with 
      cellular responsiveness to curcumin and ascorbic acid. In conclusion, this study 
      shows the effect of the curcumin/AA combination and identifies several candidate 
      genes that may regulate the response of varied cancer cells to curcumin and AA.

TI  - Cdc15 Phosphorylates the C-terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II for Transcription
      during Mitosis.
PG  - 5507-5518
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M116.761056 [doi]
AB  - In eukaryotes, the basal transcription in interphase is orchestrated through the 
      regulation by kinases (Kin28, Bur1, and Ctk1) and phosphatases (Ssu72, Rtr1, and 
      Fcp1), which act through the post-translational modification of the C-terminal
      domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. The CTD comprises the
      repeated Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser motif with potential epigenetic modification
      sites. Despite the observation of transcription and periodic expression of genes 
      during mitosis with entailing CTD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the
      associated CTD specific kinase(s) and its role in transcription remains unknown. 
      Here we have identified Cdc15 as a potential kinase phosphorylating Ser-2 and
      Ser-5 of CTD for transcription during mitosis in the budding yeast. The
      phosphorylation of CTD by Cdc15 is independent of any prior Ser
      phosphorylation(s). The inactivation of Cdc15 causes reduction of global CTD
      phosphorylation during mitosis and affects the expression of genes whose
      transcript levels peak during mitosis. Cdc15 also influences the complete
      transcription of clb2 gene and phosphorylates Ser-5 at the promoter and Ser-2
      toward the 3' end of the gene. The observation that Cdc15 could phosphorylate
      Ser-5, as well as Ser-2, during transcription in mitosis is in contrast to the
      phosphorylation marks put by the kinases in interphase (G1, S, and G2), where
      Cdck7/Kin28 phosphorylates Ser-5 at promoter and Bur1/Ctk1 phosphorylates Ser-2
      at the 3' end of the genes.

      T-cell lymphomas to BCL2 inhibitors.
PG  - 14290
LID - 10.1038/ncomms14290 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are aggressive diseases with poor response to 
      chemotherapy and dismal survival. Identification of effective strategies to
      target PTCL biology represents an urgent need. Here we report that PTCL are
      sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, and, in particular, to THZ1, a
      covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7). The STAT-signalling
      pathway is highly vulnerable to THZ1 even in PTCL cells that carry the activating
      STAT3 mutation Y640F. In mutant cells, CDK7 inhibition decreases STAT3 chromatin 
      binding and expression of highly transcribed target genes like MYC, PIM1, MCL1,
      CD30, IL2RA, CDC25A and IL4R. In surviving cells, THZ1 decreases the expression
      of STAT-regulated anti-apoptotic BH3 family members MCL1 and BCL-XL sensitizing
      PTCL cells to BH3 mimetic drugs. Accordingly, the combination of THZ1 and the BH3
      mimetic obatoclax improves lymphoma growth control in a primary PTCL ex vivo
      culture and in two STAT3-mutant PTCL xenografts, delineating a potential targeted
      agent-based therapeutic option for these patients.

AB  - Deregulation of the cell cycle by mechanisms that lead to elevated activities of 
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) is a feature of many human diseases, cancer in
      particular. We identified small-molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit
      CDK7, the kinase that phosphorylates cell-cycle CDKs to promote their activities.
      To investigate the selectivity of these inhibitors we used a combination of
      structural, biophysical, and modelling approaches. We determined the crystal
      structures of the CDK7-selective compounds ICEC0942 and ICEC0943 bound to CDK2,
      and used these to build models of inhibitor binding to CDK7. Molecular dynamics
      (MD) simulations of inhibitors bound to CDK2 and CDK7 generated possible models
      of inhibitor binding. To experimentally validate these models, we gathered
      isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding data for recombinant wild-type and
      binding site mutants of CDK7 and CDK2. We identified specific residues of CDK7,
      notably Asp155, that are involved in determining inhibitor selectivity. Our MD
      simulations also show that the flexibility of the G-rich and activation loops of 
      CDK7 is likely an important determinant of inhibitor specificity similar to CDK2.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis 
      selectively in cancer cells without affecting the majority of normal human cells.
      However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells often display resistance to
      TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Ibulocydine (IB) is an isobutyrate ester pro-drug of a
      novel synthetic Cdk inhibitor that targets Cdk7 and Cdk9. In this study, we show 
      that treatment with subtoxic doses of IB in combination with TRAIL displays
      potent cytotoxicity in TRAIL-resistant human HCC cells. Combination of IB and
      TRAIL was found to synergistically induce apoptosis through activation of
      caspases, which was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor (zVAD). Although the
      expression of Mcl-1 and survivin were reduced by IB plus TRAIL, overexpression of
      Mcl-1 and survivin did not block the cell death induced by co-treatment.
      Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-xL did not significantly interfere with the cell 
      death induced by co-treatment of IB and TRAIL. Interestingly, the combination
      treatment induced cleavage of Bax, which was translocated to mitochondria upon
      induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, down-regulation of Bax by small interfering 
      RNA effectively reduced the cell death and loss of mitochondrial membrane
      potential (MMP) caused by co-treatment with IB and TRAIL. Finally, pre-treatment 
      of HCC cells with a calpain inhibitor effectively blocked IB plus TRAIL-induced
      cleavage of Bax and apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IB
      increases the sensitivity of human HCC cells to TRAIL via mitochondria signaling 
      pathway mediated by calpain-induced cleavage of Bax, suggesting that combined
      treatment with IB and TRAIL may offer an effective therapeutic strategy for human
      HCC.

TI  - MYC Mediates mRNA Cap Methylation of Canonical Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling
      Transcripts By Recruiting CDK7 and RNA Methyltransferase.
PG  - 213-224
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-16-0247 [doi]
AB  - MYC is a pleiotropic transcription factor that activates and represses a wide
      range of target genes and is frequently deregulated in human tumors. While much
      is known about the role of MYC in transcriptional activation and repression, MYC 
      can also regulate mRNA cap methylation through a mechanism that has remained
      poorly understood. Here, it is reported that MYC enhances mRNA cap methylation of
      transcripts globally, specifically increasing mRNA cap methylation of genes
      involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Elevated mRNA cap methylation of Wnt
      signaling transcripts in response to MYC leads to augmented translational
      capacity, elevated protein levels, and enhanced Wnt signaling activity.
      Mechanistic evidence indicates that MYC promotes recruitment of RNA
      methyltransferase (RNMT) to Wnt signaling gene promoters by enhancing
      phosphorylation of serine 5 on the RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain,
      mediated in part through an interaction between the TIP60 acetyltransferase
      complex and TFIIH. IMPLICATIONS: MYC enhances mRNA cap methylation above and
      beyond transcriptional induction. Mol Cancer Res; 15(2); 213-24. (c)2016 AACR.

TI  - The emerging picture of CDK9/P-TEFb: more than 20 years of advances since
      PITALRE.
PG  - 246-276
LID - 10.1039/c6mb00387g [doi]
AB  - CDK9 is a prominent member of the transcriptional CDKs subfamily, a group of
      kinases whose function is to control the primary steps of mRNA synthesis and
      processing by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II. As a cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK9
      activation in vivo depends upon its association with T-type cyclins to assemble
      the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb). Although CDK9/P-TEFb
      phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNAP II in the same positions targeted by
      CDK7 (TFIIH) and CDK8 (Mediator), the former does not participate in the
      transcription initiation, but rather plays a unique role by driving the
      polymerase to productive elongation. In addition to RNAP II CTD, the negative
      transcription elongation factors DSIF and NELF also represent major CDK9
      substrates, whose phosphorylation is required to overcome the proximal pause of
      the polymerase. CDK9 is recruited to specific genes through proteins that
      interact with both P-TEFb and distinct elements in DNA, RNA or chromatin, where
      it modulates the activity of individual RNAP II transcription complexes. The
      regulation of CDK9 function is an intricate network that includes
      post-translational modifications (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and
      acetylation/deacetylation of key residues) as well as the association of P-TEFb
      with various proteins that can stimulate or inhibit its kinase activity. Several 
      cases of CDK9 deregulation have been linked to important human diseases,
      including various types of cancer and also AIDS (due to its essential role in HIV
      replication). Not only HIV, but also many other human viruses have been shown to 
      depend strongly on CDK9 activity to be transcribed within host cells. This review
      summarizes the main advances made on CDK9/P-TEFb field in more than 20 years,
      introducing the structural, functional and genetic aspects that have been
      elucidated ever since.

TI  - Inhibition of CDK7 bypasses spindle assembly checkpoint via premature cyclin B
      degradation during oocyte meiosis.

AB  - To ensure accurate chromosome segregation, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) 
      delays anaphase onset by preventing the premature activation of
      anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all kinetochores are attached 
      to the spindle. Although an escape from mitosis in the presence of unsatisfied
      SAC has been shown in several cancer cells, it has not been reported in oocyte
      meiosis. Here, we show that CDK7 activity is required to prevent a bypass of SAC 
      during meiosis I in mouse oocytes. Inhibition of CDK7 using THZ1 accelerated the 
      first meiosis, leading to chromosome misalignment, lag of chromosomes during
      chromosome segregation, and a high incidence of aneuploidy. Notably, this
      acceleration occurred in the presence of SAC proteins including Mad2 and Bub3 at 
      the kinetochores. However, inhibition of APC/C-mediated cyclin B degradation
      blocked the THZ1-induced premature polar body extrusion. Moreover, chromosomal
      defects mediated by THZ1 were rescued when anaphase onset was delayed.
      Collectively, our results show that CDK7 activity is required to prevent
      premature anaphase onset by suppressing the bypass of SAC, thus ensuring

TI  - Metagenomic analysis reveals the influences of milk containing antibiotics on the
      rumen microbes of calves.
PG  - 433-443
LID - 10.1007/s00203-016-1311-8 [doi]
AB  - Milk containing antibiotics is used as cost-effective feed for calves, which may 
      lead to antibiotic residues-associated food safety problems. This study aims to
      investigate the influence of antibiotics on rumen microbes. Through metagenomic
      sequencing, the rumen microbial communities of calves fed with pasteurized milk
      containing antibiotics (B1), milk containing antibiotics (B2) and fresh milk (B3)
      were explored. Each milk group included calves in 2 (T1), 3 (T2) and 6 (T3)
      months of age. Using FastQC software and SOAPdenovo 2, the filtered data,
      respectively, were performed with quality control and sequence splicing.
      Following KEGG annotation was conducted for the uploaded sequences using KAAS
      software. Using R software, both species abundance analysis and differential
      abundance analysis were performed. In the B1 samples, the species abundance of
      Bacteroidetes gradually decreased along with the extension of feeding time, while
      that of Fibrobacteres gradually increased. The species abundances of
      Proteobacteria (p value = 0.01) and Spirochaetes (p value = 0.03) had significant
      differences among T1, T2 and T3 samples. Meanwhile, only the species abundance of
      Spirochaetes (p value = 0.04) had significant difference among B1, B2 and B3
      samples. Cell cycle involving GSK3beta, CDK2 and CDK7 was significantly enriched 
      for the differentially expressed genes in the T1 versus T2 and T1 versus T3
      comparison groups. Milk containing antibiotics might have a great influence on
      these rumen microbes and lead to antibiotic residues-associated food safety
      problems. Furthermore, GSK3beta, CDK2 and CDK7 in rumen bacteria might affect
      milk fat metabolism in early growth stages of calves.

TI  - Expression of CDK7, Cyclin H, and MAT1 Is Elevated in Breast Cancer and Is
      Prognostic in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.
PG  - 5929-5938
AB  - PURPOSE: CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is required for the regulation of the cell
      cycle and is a trimeric complex consisting of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7),
      Cyclin H, and the accessory protein, MAT1. CDK7 also plays a critical role in
      regulating transcription, primarily by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II, as well
      as transcription factors such as estrogen receptor-alpha (ER). Deregulation of
      cell cycle and transcriptional control are general features of tumor cells,
      highlighting the potential for the use of CDK7 inhibitors as novel cancer
      therapeutics. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: mRNA and protein expression of CDK7 and its
      essential cofactors cyclin H and MAT1 were evaluated in breast cancer samples to 
      determine if their levels are altered in cancer. Immunohistochemical staining of 
      >900 breast cancers was used to determine the association with clinicopathologic 
      features and patient outcome. RESULTS: We show that expressions of CDK7, cyclin
      H, and MAT1 are all closely linked at the mRNA and protein level, and their
      expression is elevated in breast cancer compared with the normal breast tissue.
      Intriguingly, CDK7 expression was inversely proportional to tumor grade and size,
      and outcome analysis showed an association between CAK levels and better outcome.
      Moreover, CDK7 expression was positively associated with ER expression and in
      particular with phosphorylation of ER at serine 118, a site important for ER
      transcriptional activity. CONCLUSIONS: Expressions of components of the CAK
      complex, CDK7, MAT1, and Cyclin H are elevated in breast cancer and correlate
      with ER. Like ER, CDK7 expression is inversely proportional to poor prognostic
      factors and survival. Clin Cancer Res; 22(23); 5929-38. (c)2016 AACR.

TI  - Potential Use of Flavopiridol in Treatment of Chronic Diseases.
PG  - 209-228
AB  - This chapter describes the potential use of flavopiridol, a CDK inhibitor with
      anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities, in the treatment of various 
      chronic diseases. Flavopiridol arrests cell cycle progression in the G1 or G2
      phase by inhibiting the kinase activities of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4/6, and CDK7.
      Additionally, it binds tightly to CDK9, a component of the P-TEFb complex
      (CDK9/cyclin T), and interferes with RNA polymerase II activation and associated 
      transcription. This in turn inhibits expression of several pro-survival and
      anti-apoptotic genes, and enhances cytotoxicity in transformed cells or
      differentiation in growth-arrested cells. Recent studies indicate that
      flavopiridol elicits anti-inflammatory activity via CDK9 and NFkappaB-dependent
      signaling. Overall, these effects of flavopiridol potentiate its ability to
      overcome aberrant cell cycle activation and/or inflammatory stimuli, which are
      mediators of various chronic diseases.

TI  - Cdk7 mediates RPB1-driven mRNA synthesis in Toxoplasma gondii.
PG  - 35288
LID - 10.1038/srep35288 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 in conjunction with CyclinH and Mat1 activates cell
      cycle CDKs and is a part of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Role of Cdk7 
      is well characterized in model eukaryotes however its relevance in protozoan
      parasites has not been investigated. This important regulator of key processes
      warrants closer examination particularly in this parasite given its unique cell
      cycle progression and flexible mode of replication. We report functional
      characterization of TgCdk7 and its partners TgCyclinH and TgMat1. Recombinant
      Cdk7 displays kinase activity upon binding its cyclin partner and this activity
      is further enhanced in presence of Mat1. The activated kinase phosphorylates
      C-terminal domain of TgRPB1 suggesting its role in parasite transcription.
      Therefore, the function of Cdk7 in CTD phosphorylation and RPB1 mediated
      transcription was investigated using Cdk7 inhibitor. Unphosphorylated CTD binds
      promoter DNA while phosphorylation by Cdk7 triggers its dissociation from DNA
      with implications for transcription initiation. Inhibition of Cdk7 in the
      parasite led to strong reduction in Serine 5 phosphorylation of TgRPB1-CTD at the
      promoters of constitutively expressed actin1 and sag1 genes with concomitant
      reduction of both nascent RNA synthesis and 5'-capped transcripts. Therefore, we 
      provide compelling evidence for crucial role of TgCdk7 kinase activity in mRNA
      synthesis.

TI  - Genomic modelling of the ESR1 Y537S mutation for evaluating function and new
      therapeutic approaches for metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 2286-2296

AB  - Drugs that inhibit estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) activity have been highly
      successful in treating and reducing breast cancer progression in ER-positive
      disease. However, resistance to these therapies presents a major clinical
      problem. Recent genetic studies have shown that mutations in the ER gene are
      found in >20% of tumours that progress on endocrine therapies. Remarkably, the
      great majority of these mutations localize to just a few amino acids within or
      near the critical helix 12 region of the ER hormone binding domain, where they
      are likely to be single allele mutations. Understanding how these mutations
      impact on ER function is a prerequisite for identifying methods to treat breast
      cancer patients featuring such mutations. Towards this end, we used CRISPR-Cas9
      genome editing to make a single allele knock-in of the most commonly mutated
      amino acid residue, tyrosine 537, in the estrogen-responsive MCF7 breast cancer
      cell line. Genomic analyses using RNA-seq and ER ChIP-seq demonstrated that the
      Y537S mutation promotes constitutive ER activity globally, resulting in
      estrogen-independent growth. MCF7-Y537S cells were resistant to the anti-estrogen
      tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Further, we show that the basal transcription factor
      TFIIH is constitutively recruited by ER-Y537S, resulting in ligand-independent
      phosphorylation of Serine 118 (Ser118) by the TFIIH kinase, cyclin-dependent
      kinase (CDK)7. The CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1 prevented Ser118 phosphorylation and
      inhibited growth of MCF7-Y537S cells. These studies confirm the functional
      importance of ER mutations in endocrine resistance, demonstrate the utility of
      knock-in mutational models for investigating alternative therapeutic approaches
      and highlight CDK7 inhibition as a potential therapy for endocrine-resistant
      breast cancer mediated by ER mutations.

      expression contribute to metastatic properties of gastric cancer.
PG  - 799-805
LID - 10.1002/iub.1543 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the protein and mRNA expressions of matrix 
      metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14) and CDK7 in gastric cancer (GC) tissues.
      Upregulation of MMP14 mRNA level was observed in GC tissues when compared with
      the matched normal tissues (mean +/- SD: 3.92 +/- 1.15 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.81, P <
      0.001). This study indicated that mRNA levels of CDK7 were statistically
      overexpressed in GC when compared with matched normal tissues (4.12 +/- 0.84 vs. 
      1.43 +/- 0.71, P < 0.001). The protein levels of MMP14 were found to be increased
      in GC (60.41%; P < 0.001). The expression of CDK7 was higher in GC tissues than
      matched normal tissues (70.83; P < 0.001). We found that high MMP14 expression
      was related to advanced TNM stage (P = 0.004), tumor grade (P = 0.002), and lymph
      node metastasis (P = 0.015), but no association with other clinical variables (P 
      > 0.05). In addition, high expression of CDK7 was significantly linked to
      advanced TNM stage (P = 0.001), pathological grade (P = 0.012), and presence of
      lymph node metastasis (P = 0.009), while no correlation between CDK7 expression
      and other clinical variables, such as age and gender, distance metastasis. The
      patients with high expression of MMP14 and CDK7 exhibited worse survival time
      than those with higher levels. Cox multivariate regression analysis clearly
      showed that high expression of MMP14 and CDK7 was independent prognostic factors 
      for overall survival in patients with GC. Taken together, these results indicated
      the overexpression of above markers in the progression and the tumorigenesis of
      GC and overall patient survival. (c) 2016 IUBMB Life, 68(10):799-805, 2016.

TI  - ABCB1 as predominant resistance mechanism in cells with acquired SNS-032
      resistance.
PG  - 58051-58064
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.11160 [doi]
AB  - The CDK inhibitor SNS-032 had previously exerted promising anti-neuroblastoma
      activity via CDK7 and 9 inhibition. ABCB1 expression was identified as major
      determinant of SNS-032 resistance. Here, we investigated the role of ABCB1 in
      acquired SNS-032 resistance. In contrast to ABCB1-expressing UKF-NB-3 sub-lines
      resistant to other ABCB1 substrates, SNS-032-adapted UKF-NB-3 (UKF-NB-3rSNS-
      032300nM) cells remained sensitive to the non-ABCB1 substrate cisplatin and were 
      completely re-sensitized to cytotoxic ABCB1 substrates by ABCB1 inhibition.
      Moreover, UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells remained similarly sensitive to CDK7 and 9 
      inhibition as UKF-NB-3 cells. In contrast, SHEPrSNS-0322000nM, the
      SNS-032-resistant sub-line of the neuroblastoma cell line SHEP, displayed low
      level SNS-032 resistance also when ABCB1 was inhibited. This discrepancy may be
      explained by the higher SNS-032 concentrations that were used to establish
      SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells, since SHEP cells intrinsically express ABCB1 and are
      less sensitive to SNS-032 (IC50 912 nM) than UKF-NB-3 cells (IC50 153 nM). In
      conclusion, we show that ABCB1 expression represents the primary (sometimes
      exclusive) resistance mechanism in neuroblastoma cells with acquired resistance
      to SNS-032. Thus, ABCB1 inhibitors may increase the SNS-032 efficacy in
      ABCB1-expressing cells and prolong or avoid resistance formation.

TI  - PKC iota promotes cellular proliferation by accelerated G1/S transition via
      interaction with CDK7 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 13799-13809
AB  - Protein kinase C iota (PKCiota) has been shown to play an important role in
      tumorigenesis of many cancers. It was reported that frequent amplification and
      overexpression of PKCi were correlated with resistance to anoikis in primary
      esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). In this study, we clarified a novel
      role of PKCiota on the cell cycle progression and proliferation in ESCC. Western 
      blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis showed that the expression of
      PKCiota was higher in ESCC tumor tissues and cell lines. Meanwhile, IHC stain
      revealed that PKCiota was positively correlated with clinical pathologic
      variables such as tumor size, tumor grade, and tumor invasion, as well as ki67.
      Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assay revealed that PKCiota/CDK7 has
      the physical interaction and were co-located in the cell nucleus. And this direct
      interaction could increase the phosphorylation level of CDK7. In vitro studies
      such as starvation and refeeding assay along with PKCiota-shRNA transfection
      assay demonstrated that PKCiota expression promoted proliferation of ESCC cells. 
      And knocking PKCi down by silencing RNA (siRNA) significantly caused cell cycle
      arrest at G0/G1 phase, decreased rate of colony formation, and alleviated
      cellular apoptosis. This research provide new insights into PKCi signaling to
      more deeply understand its cancer-promoting function in ESCC.

AB  - During transcription initiation, the TFIIH-kinase Kin28/Cdk7 marks RNA polymerase
      II (Pol II) by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest
      subunit. Here we describe a structure-guided chemical approach to covalently and 
      specifically inactivate Kin28 kinase activity in vivo. This method of
      irreversible inactivation recapitulates both the lethal phenotype and the key
      molecular signatures that result from genetically disrupting Kin28 function in
      vivo. Inactivating Kin28 impacts promoter release to differing degrees and
      reveals a "checkpoint" during the transition to productive elongation. While
      promoter-proximal pausing is not observed in budding yeast, inhibition of Kin28
      attenuates elongation-licensing signals, resulting in Pol II accumulation at the 
      +2 nucleosome and reduced transition to productive elongation. Furthermore, upon 
      inhibition, global stabilization of mRNA masks different degrees of reduction in 
      nascent transcription. This study resolves long-standing controversies on the
      role of Kin28 in transcription and provides a rational approach to irreversibly
      inhibit other kinases in vivo.

TI  - CDK7 and miR-210 Co-regulate Cell-Cycle Progression of Neural Progenitors in the 
      Developing Neocortex.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms regulating neural progenitor (NP) proliferation are
      fundamental in establishing the cytoarchitecture of the mammalian neocortex. The 
      rate of cell-cycle progression and a fine-tuned balance between cell-cycle
      re-entry and exit determine the numbers of both NPs and neurons as well as
      postmitotic neuronal laminar distribution in the cortical wall. Here, we
      demonstrate that the microRNA (miRNA) miR-210 is required for normal mouse NP
      cell-cycle progression. Overexpression of miR-210 promotes premature cell-cycle
      exit and terminal differentiation in NPs, resulting in an increase in early-born 
      postmitotic neurons. Conversely, miR-210 knockdown promotes an increase in the
      radial glial cell population and delayed differentiation, resulting in an
      increase in late-born postmitotic neurons. Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase 
      CDK7 is regulated by miR-210 and is necessary for normal NP cell-cycle
      progression. Our findings demonstrate that miRNAs are essential for normal NP
      proliferation and cell-cycle progress during neocortical development.

TI  - HOXC10 Expression Supports the Development of Chemotherapy Resistance by Fine
      Tuning DNA Repair in Breast Cancer Cells.
PG  - 4443-56
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-0774 [doi]
AB  - Development of drug resistance is a major factor limiting the continued success
      of cancer chemotherapy. To overcome drug resistance, understanding the underlying
      mechanism(s) is essential. We found that HOXC10 is overexpressed in primary
      carcinomas of the breast, and even more significantly in distant metastasis
      arising after failed chemotherapy. High HOXC10 expression correlates with shorter
      recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with estrogen receptor-negative 
      breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. We found that HOXC10 promotes survival in 
      cells treated with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or carboplatin by suppressing
      apoptosis and upregulating NF-kappaB Overexpressed HOXC10 increases
      S-phase-specific DNA damage repair by homologous recombination (HR) and
      checkpoint recovery in cells at three important phases. For double-strand break
      repair, HOXC10 recruits HR proteins at sites of DNA damage. It enhances resection
      and lastly, it resolves stalled replication forks, leading to initiation of DNA
      replication following DNA damage. We show that HOXC10 facilitates, but is not
      directly involved in DNA damage repair mediated by HR. HOXC10 achieves
      integration of these functions by binding to, and activating cyclin-dependent
      kinase, CDK7, which regulates transcription by phosphorylating the
      carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Consistent with these findings,
      inhibitors of CDK7 reverse HOXC10-mediated drug resistance in cultured cells.
      Blocking HOXC10 function, therefore, presents a promising new strategy to
      overcome chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. Cancer Res; 76(15); 4443-56.

TI  - Triptolide Induces Cell Killing in Multidrug-Resistant Tumor Cells via CDK7/RPB1 
      Rather than XPB or p44.
PG  - 1495-503
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0753 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major cause of tumor treatment failure;
      therefore, drugs that can avoid this outcome are urgently needed. We studied
      triptolide, which directly kills MDR tumor cells with a high potency and a broad 
      spectrum of cell death. Triptolide did not inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug
      efflux and reduced P-gp and MDR1 mRNA resulting from transcription inhibition.
      Transcription factors including c-MYC, SOX-2, OCT-4, and NANOG were not
      correlated with triptolide-induced cell killing, but RPB1, the largest subunit of
      RNA polymerase II, was critical in mediating triptolide's inhibition of MDR
      cells. Triptolide elicited antitumor and anti-MDR activity through a universal
      mechanism: by activating CDK7 by phosphorylating Thr170 in both parental and MDR 
      cell lines and in SK-OV-3 cells. The CDK7-selective inhibitor BS-181 partially
      rescued cell killing induced by 72-hour treatment of triptolide, which may be due
      to partial rescue of RPB1 degradation. We suggest that a precise phosphorylation 
      site on RPB1 (Ser1878) was phosphorylated by CDK7 in response to triptolide. In
      addition, XPB and p44, two transcription factor TFIIH subunits, did not
      contribute to triptolide-driven RPB1 degradation and cell killing, although XPB
      was reported to covalently bind to triptolide. Several clinical trials are
      underway to test triptolide and its analogues for treating cancer and other
      diseases, so our data may help expand potential clinical uses of triptolide, as
      well as offer a compound that overcomes tumor MDR. Future investigations into the
      primary molecular target(s) of triptolide responsible for RPB1 degradation may
      suggest novel anti-MDR target(s) for therapeutic development. Mol Cancer Ther;

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive
      malignancy and the major histological subtype of oesophageal cancer. Although
      recent large-scale genomic analysis has improved the description of the genetic
      abnormalities of OSCC, few targetable genomic lesions have been identified, and
      no molecular therapy is available. This study aims to identify druggable
      candidates in this tumour. DESIGN: High-throughput small-molecule inhibitor
      screening was performed to identify potent anti-OSCC compounds.
      Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation
      sequencing (ChIP-Seq) were conducted to decipher the mechanisms of action of CDK7
      inhibition in OSCC. A variety of in vitro and in vivo cellular assays were
      performed to determine the effects of candidate genes on OSCC malignant
      phenotypes. RESULTS: The unbiased high-throughput small-molecule inhibitor
      screening led us to discover a highly potent anti-OSCC compound, THZ1, a specific
      CDK7 inhibitor. RNA-Seq revealed that low-dose THZ1 treatment caused selective
      inhibition of a number of oncogenic transcripts. Notably, further
      characterisation of the genomic features of these THZ1-sensitive transcripts
      demonstrated that they were frequently associated with super-enhancer (SE).
      Moreover, SE analysis alone uncovered many OSCC lineage-specific master
      regulators. Finally, integrative analysis of both THZ1-sensitive and
      SE-associated transcripts identified a number of novel OSCC oncogenes, including 
      PAK4, RUNX1, DNAJB1, SREBF2 and YAP1, with PAK4 being a potential druggable
      kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative approaches led to a catalogue of
      SE-associated master regulators and oncogenic transcripts, which may
      significantly promote both the understanding of OSCC biology and the development 
      of more innovative therapies.

TI  - Functional interplay between MSL1 and CDK7 controls RNA polymerase II Ser5
      phosphorylation.
PG  - 580-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3233 [doi]
AB  - Proper gene expression requires coordinated interplay among transcriptional
      coactivators, transcription factors and the general transcription machinery. We
      report here that MSL1, a central component of the dosage compensation complex in 
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, displays evolutionarily conserved
      sex-independent binding to promoters. Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal a
      functional interaction of MSL1 with CDK7, a subunit of the Cdk-activating kinase 
      (CAK) complex of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Importantly, MSL1
      depletion leads to decreased phosphorylation of Ser5 of RNA polymerase II. In
      addition, we demonstrate that MSL1 is a phosphoprotein, and transgenic flies
      expressing MSL1 phosphomutants show mislocalization of the histone
      acetyltransferase MOF and histone H4 K16 acetylation, thus ultimately causing
      male lethality due to a failure of dosage compensation. We propose that, by
      virtue of its interaction with components of the general transcription machinery,
      MSL1 exists in different phosphorylation states, thereby modulating transcription
      in flies.

AB  - CDK7 has been known as a component of CDK activating kinase (CAK) complex, the
      complex was composed of CDK7, Cyclin H and RING finger protein Mat1 that
      contribute to cell cycle progression by phosphorylating other CDKs. In addition, 
      the complex is also an essential component of general transcription factor TFIIH 
      which controls transcription via activating RNA polymerase II by serines 5 and 7 
      phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit.
      However, the role of CDK7 in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer has not been
      identified. Our study showed that CDK7 was significantly upregulated and
      positively correlated with tumor grade, infiltration depth, lymph node, Ki-67,
      and predicted poor prognosis in 173 gastric cancer specimens by
      immunohistochemistrical analyses. Furthermore, in vitro results indicated that
      CDK7 promoted proliferation of gastric cancer cells by CCK8, clone formation
      analyses and flow cytometric analyses, while CDK7 knockdown led to decreased cell
      proliferation. Our study will provide a theoretical basis for the study of CDK7
      in gastric cancer.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family members have been considered as attractive
      therapeutic targets for cancer. In this study, we aim to investigate the
      anticancer effects of a selective CDK7 inhibitor, BS-181, in gastric cancer (GC) 
      cell line. Human GC cells (BGC823) were cultured with or without BS-181 at
      different concentrations for 24-72 hours. BS-181 significantly reduced the
      activity of CDK7 with downregulation of cyclin D1 and XIAP in GC cells. Treatment
      with BS-181 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The expression of Bax and
      caspase-3 was significantly increased, while Bcl-2 expression was decreased in
      cells treated with BS-181. In addition, the inhibition of CDK7 with BS-181
      resulted in reduced rates of proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric
      cells. Those results demonstrated the anticancer activities of selective CDK7
      inhibitor BS-181 in BGC823 cells, suggesting that CDK7 may serve as a novel
      therapeutic target or the treatment of GC.

TI  - Different mechanisms of action of 2, 2', 4, 4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) 
      and its metabolites (5-OH-BDE-47 and 6-OH-BDE-47) on cell proliferation in
      OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
PG  - 1558-1567
LID - 10.1002/jat.3316 [doi]
AB  - Data concerning the possible action of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in 
      hormone-dependent cancer are scarce. Some data showed that PBDEs may directly
      affect breast cancer cells formation and only one research showed increased
      proliferation of the OVCAR-3 cells, but the results are ambiguous and the
      mechanisms are not clear. There is growing evidence that not only parent
      compounds but also its metabolites may be involved in cancer development. The
      present study was, therefore, designed to determine the effect of BDE-47 and its 
      metabolites (2.5 to 50 ng ml(-1) ) on proliferation (BrdU), cell-cycle genes
      (real-time PCR) and protein expression (Western blot), protein expression of
      oestrogen receptors (alpha beta), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 
      (ERK1/2) and protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) in OVCAR-3 ovarian and MCF-7 breast
      cancer cells. In OVCAR-3 cells, the parent compound stimulated cell proliferation
      by activating CDK1, CDK7, E2F1 and E2F2. Independent of time of exposure, BDE-47 
      had no effect on ERalpha and ERbeta protein expression and ERK1/2 and PKCalpha
      phosphorylation. Metabolites had no effect on cell proliferation but increased
      both ERs protein expression and ERK1/2 and PKCalpha phosphorylation. In MCF-7
      cells, the parent compound displayed no effect on cell proliferation but
      decreased ERalpha and increased ERbeta protein expression with concomitant
      induction of PKCalpha phosphorylation. Both metabolites increased MCF-7 cell
      proliferation, ERK1/2 and PKCalpha phosphorylation and decreased ERalpha and
      ERbeta protein expression.We suggest that studies concerning PBDEs with fewer
      bromine atoms should be continued to understand environmental links to different 
      hormone-dependent cancers. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Molecular cloning and expression analysis of MAT1 gene in black tiger shrimp
      (Penaeus monodon).
LID - 10.4238/gmr.15017367 [doi]
AB  - MAT1 (menage a trois 1), an assembly factor and targeting subunit of the
      CDK-dependent kinase (CAK), can regulate the cell cycle, transcription, and DNA
      repair. This study was intended to investigate the role of MAT1 in the
      reproductive maturation of black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). In this study,
      the P. monodon MAT1 (PmMAT1) gene was identified and characterized. The
      full-length cDNA of PmMAT1 was 1490 bp in length with an open-reading frame of
      993 bp corresponding to 330 amino acids. The temporal expression of PmMAT1 in
      various tissues was measured by quantitative real-time PCR with the highest
      expression observed in ovaries. In the ovaries, the PmMAT1 gene was continuously 
      but differentially expressed during the maturation stages. Comparative analyses
      of MAT1, CDK7, and cyclin H in the CAK complex of P. monodon indicated that the
      expression of CDK7 and cyclin H coincided with that of MAT1 during the ovary
      maturation stages. Serotonin (5-HT) injection promoted the expression level of
      PmMAT1 in the ovaries of shrimp at 6-48 h post-injection. These results indicate 
      that PmMat1 plays a prominent role in the process of ovarian maturation.

AB  - The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II contains a C-terminal domain (CTD) that 
      plays key roles in coordinating transcription with co-transcriptional events. The
      heptapeptide repeats that form the CTD are dynamically phosphorylated on serine, 
      tyrosine and threonine residues during the various steps of transcription,
      thereby regulating the recruitment of various proteins involved in gene
      expression. In this "Perspective," we review the recent literature related to the
      function of the CTD, to CTD kinases (Kin28, CDK7, CDK9, CDK12, ERK1/2 and DYRK1A)
      and to CTD phosphatases (Rtr1, RPAP2, Ssu72, Fcp1 and Gcl7). We discuss
      unresolved and controversial issues and try to provide constructive suggestions. 
      This review also highlights emerging themes in the CTD field, such as crosstalk
      and feedback mechanisms, as well as gene-specific and tissue-specific functions
      of the CTD. Finally, promising therapeutic avenues for a recently developed CTD
      kinase inhibitor are discussed.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases regulate the cell cycle and transcription in higher
      eukaryotes. We have determined the crystal structure of the transcription kinase 
      Cdk13 and its Cyclin K subunit at 2.0 A resolution. Cdk13 contains a C-terminal
      extension helix composed of a polybasic cluster and a DCHEL motif that interacts 
      with the bound ATP. Cdk13/CycK phosphorylates both Ser5 and Ser2 of the RNA
      polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) with a preference for Ser7
      pre-phosphorylations at a C-terminal position. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1
      does not change the phosphorylation specificities of Cdk9, Cdk12, and Cdk13 but
      interacts with the phosphorylated CTD through its WW domain. Using recombinant
      proteins, we find that flavopiridol inhibits Cdk7 more potently than it does
      Cdk13. Gene expression changes after knockdown of Cdk13 or Cdk12 are markedly
      different, with enrichment of growth signaling pathways for Cdk13-dependent
      genes. Together, our results provide insights into the structure, function, and
      activity of human Cdk13/CycK.

AB  - Transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases play important roles in eukaryotic gene 
      expression. CDK7, CDK9 (P-TEFb), and CDK13 are also critical for HIV replication.
      However, the function of CDK11 remained enigmatic. In this report, we determined 
      that CDK11 regulates the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) of all viral
      transcripts. CDK11 was found associated with the TREX/THOC, which recruited this 
      kinase to DNA. Once at the viral genome, CDK11 phosphorylated serines at position
      2 in the CTD of RNAPII, which increased levels of CPA factors at the HIV 3' end. 
      In its absence, cleavage of viral transcripts was greatly attenuated. In
      contrast, higher levels of CDK11 increased the length of HIV poly(A) tails and
      the stability of mature viral transcripts. We conclude that CDK11 plays a
      critical role for the cotranscriptional processing of all HIV mRNA species.

TI  - The Ccl1-Kin28 kinase complex regulates autophagy under nitrogen starvation.
PG  - 135-44
LID - 10.1242/jcs.177071 [doi]
AB  - Starvation triggers global alterations in the synthesis and turnover of proteins.
      Under such conditions, the recycling of essential nutrients by using autophagy is
      indispensable for survival. By screening known kinases in the yeast genome, we
      newly identified a regulator of autophagy, the Ccl1-Kin28 kinase complex (the
      equivalent of the mammalian cyclin-H-Cdk7 complex), which is known to play key
      roles in RNA-polymerase-II-mediated transcription. We show that inactivation of
      Ccl1 caused complete block of autophagy. Interestingly, Ccl1 itself was subject
      to proteasomal degradation, limiting the level of autophagy during prolonged
      starvation. We present further evidence that the Ccl1-Kin28 complex regulates the
      expression of Atg29 and Atg31, which is crucial in the assembly of the Atg1
      kinase complex. The identification of this previously unknown regulatory pathway 
      sheds new light on the complex signaling network that governs autophagy activity.

TI  - Molecular simulation studies on the binding selectivity of
      2-anilino-4-(thiazol-5-yl)-pyrimidines in complexes with CDK2 and CDK7.
PG  - 145-61
LID - 10.1039/c5mb00630a [doi]
AB  - Cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) was regarded as a potentially therapeutic target
      for cancer therapy. Since the CDK family includes couples of high homology
      members, designing CDK2-selective inhibitors would provide valuable opportunities
      for the development of anticancer drugs with optimal efficacy. In this study,
      three thiazo-5-yl-pyrimidines as CDK2 inhibitors with different selectivity over 
      cyclin dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) were examined to study the selectivity mechanism
      using a combined approach of computational techniques of flexible docking,
      EasyMIFs, molecular electrostatic potential (MESP), natural bond orbital (NBO),
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy calculations.
      Molecular simulations elicited new chemical insights into steric and electronic
      complementarities of these molecules to the binding sites of CDK2 and CDK7. The
      computed binding free energies were consistent with the ranking of their
      experimental binding affinities on CDK2 and CDK7. We also conducted in silico
      mutations of three key amino acids (CDK2: Gln85, Lys89, Asp145) to examine their 
      impact on ligand binding with MD simulations and binding free energy
      calculations. The results indicated that these residues exhibited a strong
      tendency to mediate ligand-protein interactions through the H-bond and vdW
      interaction with CDK2-selective inhibitor. The present work may provide a better 
      structural understanding of the molecular mechanism of CDK2 selective inhibition.
      The new computational insights presented in this study are expected to be
      valuable for the guidelines and development of new potent CDK2 inhibitors.

TI  - New insight into the phosphorylation-regulated intranuclear localization of human
      cytomegalovirus pUL69 mediated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and viral CDK
      orthologue pUL97.
PG  - 144-51
LID - 10.1099/jgv.0.000337 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are multifaceted regulators involved in the
      replication of human cytomegalovirus. Recently, we demonstrated an interaction of
      CDK9-cyclin T1 as well as viral CDK orthologue pUL97 with the viral regulator
      pUL69, thereby leading to pUL69-activating phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate 
      that colocalization and direct pUL69-cyclin T1 interaction is independent of
      viral strains and host cell types. In vitro phosphorylation of pUL69 by CDK9 or
      pUL97 did not occur in a single site-specific manner, but at multiple sites. The 
      previously described fine-speckled nuclear aggregation of pUL69 was assigned to
      the late phase of viral replication. CDK inhibitors, including a novel inhibitor 
      of the CDK-activating kinase CDK7, massively intensified this fine-speckled
      accumulation. Interestingly, we also observed spontaneous pUL69 accumulation in
      the absence of inhibitors at a lower frequency. These findings provide new
      insight into pUL69 kinase interregulation and emphasize the importance of pUL69
      phosphorylation for correct intranuclear localization.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) play key roles at different checkpoint
      regulations of the eukaryotic cell cycle. However, only few studies of
      lepidoptera CDK family proteins have been reported so far. In this study, we
      performed the cDNA sequencing of 10 members of the CDK family in Bombyx mori.
      Gene structure analysis suggested that CDK12 and CDC2L1 owned two and three
      isoforms, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CDK genes in different 
      species were highly conserved, implying that they evolved independently even
      before the split between vertebrates and invertebrates. We found that the
      expression levels of BmCDKs in 13 tissues of fifth-instar day 3 larvae were
      different: CDK1, CDK7, and CDK9 had a high level of expression, whereas CDK4 was 
      low-level expressed and was detected only in the testes and fat body cells.
      Similar expression profiles of BmCDKs during embryo development were obtained.
      Among the variants of CDK12, CDK12 transcript variant A had the highest
      expression, and the expression of CDC2L1 transcript variant A was the highest
      among the variants of CDC2L1. It was shown from the RNAi experiments that the
      silencing of CDK1, CDK10, CDK12, and CDC2L1 could influence the cells from G0/G1 
      to S phase transition.

TI  - Mediator kinase inhibition further activates super-enhancer-associated genes in
      AML.
PG  - 273-276

AB  - Super-enhancers (SEs), which are composed of large clusters of enhancers densely 
      loaded with the Mediator complex, transcription factors and chromatin regulators,
      drive high expression of genes implicated in cell identity and disease, such as
      lineage-controlling transcription factors and oncogenes. BRD4 and CDK7 are
      positive regulators of SE-mediated transcription. By contrast, negative
      regulators of SE-associated genes have not been well described. Here we show that
      the Mediator-associated kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and CDK19
      restrain increased activation of key SE-associated genes in acute myeloid
      leukaemia (AML) cells. We report that the natural product cortistatin A (CA)
      selectively inhibits Mediator kinases, has anti-leukaemic activity in vitro and
      in vivo, and disproportionately induces upregulation of SE-associated genes in
      CA-sensitive AML cell lines but not in CA-insensitive cell lines. In AML cells,
      CA upregulated SE-associated genes with tumour suppressor and lineage-controlling
      functions, including the transcription factors CEBPA, IRF8, IRF1 and ETV6 (refs
      6-8). The BRD4 inhibitor I-BET151 downregulated these SE-associated genes, yet
      also has anti-leukaemic activity. Individually increasing or decreasing the
      expression of these transcription factors suppressed AML cell growth, providing
      evidence that leukaemia cells are sensitive to the dosage of SE-associated genes.
      Our results demonstrate that Mediator kinases can negatively regulate
      SE-associated gene expression in specific cell types, and can be
      pharmacologically targeted as a therapeutic approach to AML.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer
      that exhibits extremely high levels of genetic complexity and yet a relatively
      uniform transcriptional program. We postulate that TNBC might be highly dependent
      on uninterrupted transcription of a key set of genes within this gene expression 
      program and might therefore be exceptionally sensitive to inhibitors of
      transcription. Utilizing kinase inhibitors and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing,
      we show here that triple-negative but not hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
      cells are exceptionally dependent on CDK7, a transcriptional cyclin-dependent
      kinase. TNBC cells are unique in their dependence on this transcriptional CDK and
      suffer apoptotic cell death upon CDK7 inhibition. An "Achilles cluster" of
      TNBC-specific genes is especially sensitive to CDK7 inhibition and frequently
      associated with super-enhancers. We conclude that CDK7 mediates transcriptional
      addiction to a vital cluster of genes in TNBC and CDK7 inhibition may be a useful
      therapy for this challenging cancer.

AB  - The serine-threonine kinase CDK9 is a target of emerging interest for the
      development of anti-cancer drugs. There are multiple lines of evidence linking
      CDK9 activity to cancer, including the essential role this kinase plays in
      transcriptional regulation through phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD)
      of RNA polymerase II. Indeed, inhibition of CDK9 has been shown to result in a
      reduction of short-lived proteins such as the pro-survival protein Mcl-1 in
      malignant cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. In this work we report our
      initial studies towards the discovery of selective CDK9 inhibitors, starting from
      the known multi-kinase inhibitor PIK-75 which possesses potent CDK9 activity. Our
      series is based on a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine nucleus and, importantly, the
      resultant lead compound 18b is devoid of the structural liabilities present in
      PIK-75 and possesses greater selectivity.

TI  - Functional interaction of Rpb1 and Spt5 C-terminal domains in co-transcriptional 
      histone modification.
PG  - 9766-75
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkv837 [doi]
AB  - Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is accompanied by a conserved pattern
      of histone modifications that plays important roles in regulating gene
      expression. The establishment of this pattern requires phosphorylation of both
      Rpb1 (the largest RNAPII subunit) and the elongation factor Spt5 on their
      respective C-terminal domains (CTDs). Here we interrogated the roles of
      individual Rpb1 and Spt5 CTD phospho-sites in directing co-transcriptional
      histone modifications in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
      Steady-state levels of methylation at histone H3 lysines 4 (H3K4me) and 36
      (H3K36me) were sensitive to multiple mutations of the Rpb1 CTD repeat motif
      (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7). Ablation of the Spt5 CTD phospho-site Thr1 reduced H3K4me
      levels but had minimal effects on H3K36me. Nonetheless, Spt5 CTD mutations
      potentiated the effects of Rpb1 CTD mutations on H3K36me, suggesting overlapping 
      functions. Phosphorylation of Rpb1 Ser2 by the Cdk12 orthologue Lsk1 positively
      regulated H3K36me but negatively regulated H3K4me. H3K36me and histone H2B
      monoubiquitylation required Rpb1 Ser5 but were maintained upon inactivation of
      Mcs6/Cdk7, the major kinase for Rpb1 Ser5 in vivo, implicating another Ser5
      kinase in these regulatory pathways. Our results elaborate the CTD 'code' for
      co-transcriptional histone modifications.

AB  - The Cdk7 subunit of TFIIH phosphorylates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during
      initiation, and, while recent studies show that inhibition of human Cdk7
      negatively influences transcription, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Using
      in vitro transcription with nuclear extract, we demonstrate that THZ1, a covalent
      Cdk7 inhibitor, causes defects in Pol II phosphorylation, co-transcriptional
      capping, promoter proximal pausing, and productive elongation. THZ1 does not
      affect initiation but blocks essentially all Pol II large subunit C-terminal
      domain (CTD) phosphorylation. We found that guanylylation of nascent RNAs is
      length dependent and modulated by a THZ1-sensitive factor present in nuclear
      extract. THZ1 impacts pausing through a capping-independent block of DSIF and
      NELF loading. The P-TEFb-dependent transition into productive elongation was also
      inhibited by THZ1, likely due to loss of DSIF. Capping and pausing were also
      reduced in THZ1-treated cells. Our results provide mechanistic insights into THZ1
      action and how Cdk7 broadly influences transcription and capping.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have been traditionally associated with the cell 
      cycle. However, it is now known that CDK7 and CDK9 regulate transcriptional
      activity via phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and subsequent synthesis of,
      for example, inflammatory mediators and factors that influence the apoptotic
      process; including apoptosis of granulocytes such as neutrophils and eosinophils.
      Successful resolution of inflammation and restoration of normal tissue
      homeostasis requires apoptosis of these inflammatory cells and subsequent
      clearance of apoptotic bodies by phagocytes such as macrophages. It is believed
      that CDK7 and CDK9 influence resolution of inflammation since they are involved
      in the transcription of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 which is especially
      important in granulocyte survival.This chapter describes various in vitro and in 
      vivo models used to investigate CDKs and their inhibitors in granulocytes and
      particularly the role of CDKs in the apoptosis pathway. This can be performed in 
      vitro by isolation and use of primary granulocytes and in vivo using animal
      models of inflammatory disease in rodents and zebrafish. Some of the methods
      described here to assess the role of CDKs in inflammation and apoptosis include
      flow cytometry and western blotting, together with imaging and quantification of 
      apoptosis in fixed tissue, as well as in vivo models of inflammation.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases have established roles in the regulation of cell cycle, 
      in gene expression and in cell differentiation. Many of these kinases have been
      considered as drug targets and numerous efforts have been made to develop
      specific and potent inhibitors against them. The first step in all of these
      attempts and in many other biochemical analyses is the production of highly
      purified and reliable kinase, most frequently in a recombinant form. In this
      chapter we describe our experience in the cloning, expression, and purification
      of CDKs using CDK7/CycH, CDK8/CycC, and CDK9/CycT1 as an example.

TI  - Binding Pattern Elucidation of NNK and NNAL Cigarette Smoke Carcinogens with NER 
      Pathway Enzymes: an Onco- Informatics Study.
PG  - 5311-7
AB  - Cigarette smoke derivatives like NNK
      (4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) and NNAL
      (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butan-1-ol) are well-known carcinogens. We
      analyzed the interaction of enzymes involved in the NER (nucleotide excision
      repair) pathway with ligands (NNK and NNAL). Binding was characterized for the
      enzymes sharing equivalent or better interaction as compared to +Ve control. The 
      highest obtained docking energy between NNK and enzymes RAD23A, CCNH, CDK7, and
      CETN2 were -7.13 kcal/mol, -7.27 kcal/mol, -8.05 kcal/mol and -7.58 kcal/mol
      respectively. Similarly the highest obtained docking energy between NNAL and
      enzymes RAD23A, CCNH, CDK7, and CETN2 were -7.46 kcal/mol, -7.94 kcal/mol, -7.83 
      kcal/mol and -7.67 kcal/mol respectively. In order to find out the effect of NNK 
      and NNAL on enzymes involved in the NER pathway applying protein-protein
      interaction and protein-complex (i.e. enzymes docked with NNK/NNAL) interaction
      analysis. It was found that carcinogens are well capable to reduce the normal
      functioning of genes like RAD23A (HR23A), CCNH, CDK7 and CETN2. In silico
      analysis indicated loss of functions of these genes and their corresponding
      enzymes, which possibly might be a cause for alteration of DNA repair pathways
      leading to damage buildup and finally contributing to cancer formation.

PG  - 135
LID - 10.3978/j.issn.2305-5839.2015.03.61 [doi]
AB  - Roscovitine [CY-202, (R)-Roscovitine, Seliciclib] is a small molecule that
      inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) through direct competition at the
      ATP-binding site. It is a broad-range purine inhibitor, which inhibits CDK1,
      CDK2, CDK5 and CDK7, but is a poor inhibitor for CDK4 and CDK6. Roscovitine is
      widely used as a biological tool in cell cycle, cancer, apoptosis and
      neurobiology studies. Moreover, it is currently evaluated as a potential drug to 
      treat cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, viral infections,
      polycystic kidney disease and glomerulonephritis. This review focuses on the use 
      of roscovitine in the disease model as well as clinical model research.

TI  - Growth inhibitory and chemo-sensitization effects of naringenin, a natural
      flavanone purified from Thymus vulgaris, on human breast and colorectal cancer.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s12935-015-0194-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural products with diverse bioactivities are becoming an important
      source of novel agents with medicinal potential. Cancer is a devastating disease 
      that causes the death of millions of people each year. Thus, intense research has
      been conducted on several natural products to develop novel anticancer drugs.
      METHODS: Chromatographic and spectral techniques were used for the isolation and 
      identification of naringenin (Nar). MTT, flow cytometry, western blotting, Real
      Time PCR were used to test anticancer and chemosensitizing effects of Nar, cell
      cycle, apoptosis, and expression of cell cycle, apoptosis, pro-survival and
      anti-survival-related genes. RESULTS: In the present study, Thymus vulgaris
      ethanol extract was purified repeatedly to produce several compounds including
      the known flavanone, Nar which was identified using different spectral
      techniques. Nar was shown to inhibit both human colorectal and breast cancer cell
      growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner through cell cycle arrest at S- and
      G2/M-phases accompanied by an increase in apoptotic cell death. Additionally, Nar
      altered the expression of apoptosis and cell-cycle regulatory genes by
      down-regulating Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdk7, Bcl2, x-IAP and c-IAP-2 and up-regulating p18, 
      p19, p21, caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9, Bak, AIF and Bax in both colorectal and breast 
      cancer cells. Conversely, it diminished the expression levels of the cell
      survival factors PI3K, pAkt, pIkappaBalpha and NFkappaBp65. Moreover, Nar
      enhanced the sensitivity of colorectal and breast cancer cells to DNA-acting
      drugs. DISCUSSION: These findings provide evidence that Nar's pro-apoptotic and
      chemo-sensitizing effects are mediated by perturbation of cell cycle,
      upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes
      and inhibition of pro-survival signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Nar
      might be a promising candidate for chemoprevention and/or chemotherapy of human
      cancers. However, further studies exploring this therapeutic strategy are
      necessary.

TI  - Interaction with CCNH/CDK7 facilitates CtBP2 promoting esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma (ESCC) metastasis via upregulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      (EMT) progression.
PG  - 6701-14
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-3354-x [doi]
AB  - CtBP2, as a transcriptional corepressor of epithelial-specific genes, has been
      reported to promote tumor due to upregulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      (EMT) in cancer cells. CtBP2 was also demonstrated to contribute to the
      proliferation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells through a
      negative transcriptional regulation of p16(INK4A). In this study, for the first
      time, we reported that CtBP2 expression, along with CCNH/CDK7, was higher in ESCC
      tissues with lymph node metastases than in those without lymph node metastases.
      Moreover, both CtBP2 and CCNH/CDK7 were positively correlated with E-cadherin,
      tumor grade, and tumor metastasis. However, the concrete mechanism of CtBP2's
      role in enhancing ESCC migration remains incompletely understood. We confirmed
      that CCNH/CDK7 could directly interact with CtBP2 in ESCC cells in vivo and in
      vitro. Furthermore, our data demonstrate for the first time that CtBP2 enhanced
      the migration of ESCC cells in a CCNH/CDK7-dependent manner. Our results
      indicated that CCNH/CDK7-CtBP2 axis may augment ESCC cell migration, and
      targeting the interaction of both may provide a novel therapeutic target of ESCC.

      develop recurrent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within 1-3 years.
      Treatment with caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) suppressed cell survival and
      proliferation via induction of G1 or G2/M cell cycle arrest in LNCaP 104-R1,
      DU-145, 22Rv1, and C4-2 CRPC cells. CAPE treatment also inhibited soft agar
      colony formation and retarded nude mice xenograft growth of LNCaP 104-R1 cells.
      We identified that CAPE treatment significantly reduced protein abundance of
      Skp2, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk7, Rb, phospho-Rb S807/811, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin H,
      E2F1, c-Myc, SGK, phospho-p70S6kinase T421/S424, phospho-mTOR Ser2481,
      phospho-GSK3alpha Ser21, but induced p21Cip1, p27Kip1, ATF4, cyclin E, p53,
      TRIB3, phospho-p53 (Ser6, Ser33, Ser46, Ser392), phospho-p38 MAPK Thr180/Tyr182, 
      Chk1, Chk2, phospho-ATM S1981, phospho-ATR S428, and phospho-p90RSK Ser380. CAPE 
      treatment decreased Skp2 and Akt1 protein expression in LNCaP 104-R1 tumors as
      compared to control group. Overexpression of Skp2, or siRNA knockdown of p21Cip1,
      p27Kip1, or p53 blocked suppressive effect of CAPE treatment. Co-treatment of
      CAPE with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT737 showed synergistic
      suppressive effects. Our finding suggested that CAPE treatment induced cell cycle
      arrest and growth inhibition in CRPC cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1, 
      and p27Kip1.

TI  - Fission yeast Cdk7 controls gene expression through both its CAK and C-terminal
      domain kinase activities.
PG  - 1480-90
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00024-15 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activation and RNA polymerase II transcription are 
      linked by the Cdk7 kinase, which phosphorylates Cdks as a trimeric Cdk-activating
      kinase (CAK) complex, and serine 5 within the polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal
      domain (CTD) as transcription factor TFIIH-bound CAK. However, the physiological 
      importance of integrating these processes is not understood. Besides the Cdk7
      ortholog Mcs6, fission yeast possesses a second CAK, Csk1. The two enzymes have
      been proposed to act redundantly to activate Cdc2. Using an improved
      analogue-sensitive Mcs6-as kinase, we show that Csk1 is not a relevant CAK for
      Cdc2. Further analyses revealed that Csk1 lacks a 20-amino-acid sequence required
      for its budding yeast counterpart, Cak1, to bind Cdc2. Transcriptome profiling of
      the Mcs6-as mutant in the presence or absence of the budding yeast Cak1 kinase,
      in order to uncouple the CTD kinase and CAK activities of Mcs6, revealed an
      unanticipated role of the CAK branch in the transcriptional control of the
      cluster of genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis and cell growth. The analysis 
      of a Cdc2 CAK site mutant confirmed these data. Our data show that the Cdk7
      kinase modulates transcription through its well-described RNA Pol II CTD kinase
      activity and also through the Cdc2-activating kinase activity.

TI  - A novel CDK7 inhibitor of the Pyrazolotriazine class exerts broad-spectrum
      antiviral activity at nanomolar concentrations.
PG  - 2062-71
LID - 10.1128/AAC.04534-14 [doi]
AB  - Protein kinases represent central and multifunctional regulators of a balanced
      virus-host interaction. Cyclin-dependent protein kinase 7 (CDK7) plays crucial
      regulatory roles in cell cycle and transcription, both connected with the
      replication of many viruses. Previously, we developed a CDK7 inhibitor, LDC4297, 
      that inhibits CDK7 in vitro in the nano-picomolar range. Novel data from a
      kinome-wide evaluation (>330 kinases profiled in vitro) demonstrate a kinase
      selectivity. Importantly, we provide first evidence for the antiviral potential
      of the CDK7 inhibitor LDC4297, i.e., in exerting a block of the replication of
      human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in primary human fibroblasts at nanomolar
      concentrations (50% effective concentration, 24.5 +/- 1.3 nM). As a unique
      feature compared to approved antiherpesviral drugs, inhibition occurred already
      at the immediate-early level of HCMV gene expression. The mode of antiviral
      action was considered multifaceted since CDK7-regulated cellular factors that are
      supportive of HCMV replication were substantially affected by the inhibitors. An 
      effect of LDC4297 was identified in the interference with HCMV-driven
      inactivation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a regulatory step generally
      considered a hallmark of herpesviral replication. In line with this finding, a
      broad inhibitory activity of the drug could be demonstrated against a selection
      of human and animal herpesviruses and adenoviruses, whereas other viruses only
      showed intermediate drug sensitivity. Summarized, the CDK7 inhibitor LDC4297 is a
      promising candidate for further antiviral drug development, possibly offering new
      options for a comprehensive approach to antiviral therapy.

      lines.
PG  - 95-106
LID - 10.1111/vco.12130 [doi]
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, flavopiridol, was tested as a
      potential new cancer therapeutic agent to treat canine lymphoma by examining its 
      effect on cell growth of canine lymphoma cell lines in vitro. Flavopiridol
      induced profound cell death in all eight lymphoma cell lines at 400 nM, and in
      all cases cell death was due to apoptosis. Apoptosis was inhibited by caspase
      inhibitor, despite the variable sensitivities between cell lines. Analysis of the
      mechanism of flavopiridol-induced apoptosis showed that Rb phosphorylation was
      inhibited, possibly due to CDK4 or CDK6 inhibition. There was also decreased
      expression of Rb protein and anti-apoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 and XIAP, possibly
      through transcriptional regulation by inhibition of CDK7 or CDK9 activation.
      Canine lymphoma cell line-xenotransplanted mice were then treated with
      flavopiridol and profound tumour shrinkage was observed. This study describes a
      new therapeutic approach using flavopiridol for canine lymphoma treatment.

AB  - Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) involves the coordinated 
      action of numerous regulatory factors. Among these are chromatin-modifying
      enzymes, which generate a stereotypic and conserved pattern of histone
      modifications along transcribed genes. This pattern implies a precise
      coordination between regulators of histone modification and the RNAP II
      elongation complex. Here I review the pathways and molecular events that regulate
      co-transcriptional histone modifications. Insight into these events will
      illuminate the assembly of functional RNAP II elongation complexes and how the
      chromatin landscape influences their composition and function.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality, and
      the identification of effective pharmacological strategies to target SCLC biology
      represents an urgent need. Using a high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse
      chemical library, we observe that SCLC is sensitive to transcription-targeting
      drugs, in particular to THZ1, a recently identified covalent inhibitor of
      cyclin-dependent kinase 7. We find that expression of super-enhancer-associated
      transcription factor genes, including MYC family proto-oncogenes and
      neuroendocrine lineage-specific factors, is highly vulnerability to THZ1
      treatment. We propose that downregulation of these transcription factors
      contributes, in part, to SCLC sensitivity to transcriptional inhibitors and that 
      THZ1 represents a prototype drug for tailored SCLC therapy.

AB  - The MYC oncoproteins are thought to stimulate tumor cell growth and proliferation
      through amplification of gene transcription, a mechanism that has thwarted most
      efforts to inhibit MYC function as potential cancer therapy. Using a covalent
      inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) to disrupt the transcription of
      amplified MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrate downregulation of the
      oncoprotein with consequent massive suppression of MYCN-driven global
      transcriptional amplification. This response translated to significant tumor
      regression in a mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma, without the introduction 
      of systemic toxicity. The striking treatment selectivity of MYCN-overexpressing
      cells correlated with preferential downregulation of super-enhancer-associated
      genes, including MYCN and other known oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma. These
      results indicate that CDK7 inhibition, by selectively targeting the mechanisms
      that promote global transcriptional amplification in tumor cells, may be useful
      therapy for cancers that are driven by MYC family oncoproteins.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of cyclindependent
      kinase 7 (CDK7) silencing on the sensitivity of the HEC1A endometrial carcinoma
      cell line to cisplatin [cisdichlorodiammineplatinum (II), or DDP]. Four CDK7
      siRNA fragments were designed and synthesized based on the gene sequence of CDK7 
      and transfected into HEC1A cells. The RNA interference of the fragments was
      confirmed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot
      analyses. The CDK7423 siRNA fragment exhibited the most marked silencing of CDK7 
      (>70%), and was chosen for the subsequent experiments in HEC1A endometrial
      carcinoma cells. The sensitivity of the cells to a chemotherapeutic agent
      (cisplatin) was determined before and after transfection of the siRNA, using a
      MTT cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry and Hoechst/propidium iodide (PI)
      doublestaining immunofluorescence microscopy. The results of the MTT cytotoxicity
      assay showed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration of cisplatin was
      reduced from 45.12 microg/ml to 3.200 microg/ml following the inhibition of CDK7 
      expression levels, indicating a significantly increased cytotoxicity in the
      treated cells (P<0.05). The flow cytometry analysis showed that the mean rate of 
      apoptosis in the CDK7 lowexpression group was 37.57%, which was significantly
      higher than the rate in the parental cells (11.66%) (P<0.05). Hoechst/PI
      coimmunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the number of apoptotic bodies in
      the CDK7 lowexpression HEC1A cells was significantly increased as compared with
      the parental cells. Downregulation of CDK7 expression levels in HEC1A endometrial
      carcinoma cells via the transfection of CDK7 siRNA may significantly enhance
      cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin chemotherapy and increasing apoptosis. CDK7

TI  - Transcription cofactor PC4 plays essential roles in collaboration with the small 
      subunit of general transcription factor TFIIE.
PG  - 879-90

AB  - In eukaryotes, positive cofactor 4 (PC4) stimulates activator-dependent
      transcription by facilitating transcription initiation and the transition from
      initiation to elongation. It also forms homodimers and binds to single-stranded
      DNA and various transcriptional activators, including the general transcription
      factor TFIIH. In this study, we further investigated PC4 from Homo sapiens and
      the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (hPC4 and cePC4, respectively). hPC4 strongly
      stimulated transcription on a linearized template, whereas it alleviated
      transcription on a supercoiled template. Transcriptional stimulation by PC4 was
      also alleviated by increasing the amount of TFIID. GST pull-down studies with
      general transcription factors indicated that both hPC4 and cePC4 bind strongly to
      TFIIB, TFIIEbeta, TFIIFalpha, TFIIFbeta and TFIIH XPB subunits and weakly to TBP 
      and TFIIH p62. However, only hPC4 bound to CDK7. The effect of each PC4 on
      transcription was studied in combination with TFIIEbeta. hPC4 stimulated both
      basal and activated transcription, whereas cePC4 primarily stimulated activated
      transcription, especially in the presence of TFIIEbeta from C. elegans. Finally, 
      hPC4 bound to the C-terminal region of hTFIIEbeta adjacent to the basic region.
      These results indicate that PC4 plays essential roles in the transition step from
      transcription initiation to elongation by binding to melted DNA in collaboration 
      with TFIIEbeta.

TI  - Androgen suppresses the proliferation of androgen receptor-positive
      castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of Cdk2, CyclinA, and
      Skp2.
PG  - e109170
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0109170 [doi]
AB  - The majority of prostate cancer (PCa) patient receiving androgen ablation therapy
      eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We previously
      reported that androgen treatment suppresses Skp2 and c-Myc through androgen
      receptor (AR) and induced G1 cell cycle arrest in androgen-independent LNCaP
      104-R2 cells, a late stage CRPC cell line model. However, the mechanism of
      androgenic regulation of Skp2 in CRPC cells was not fully understood. In this
      study, we investigated the androgenic regulation of Skp2 in two AR-positive CRPC 
      cell line models, the LNCaP 104-R1 and PC-3AR Cells. The former one is an early
      stage androgen-independent LNCaP cells, while the later one is PC-3 cells
      re-expressing either wild type AR or mutant LNCaP AR. Proliferation of LNCaP
      104-R1 and PC-3AR cells is not dependent on but is suppressed by androgen. We
      observed in this study that androgen treatment reduced protein expression of
      Cdk2, Cdk7, Cyclin A, cyclin H, Skp2, c-Myc, and E2F-1; lessened phosphorylation 
      of Thr14, Tyr15, and Thr160 on Cdk2; decreased activity of Cdk2; induced protein 
      level of p27(Kip1); and caused G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCaP 104-R1 cells and
      PC-3AR cells. Overexpression of Skp2 protein in LNCaP 104-R1 or PC-3AR cells
      partially blocked accumulation of p27(Kip1) and increased Cdk2 activity under
      androgen treatment, which partially blocked the androgenic suppressive effects on
      proliferation and cell cycle. Analyzing on-line gene array data of 214 normal and
      PCa samples indicated that gene expression of Skp2, Cdk2, and cyclin A positively
      correlates to each other, while Cdk7 negatively correlates to these genes. These 
      observations suggested that androgen suppresses the proliferation of CRPC cells
      partially through inhibition of Cyclin A, Cdk2, and Skp2.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinases.
PG  - 122
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are protein kinases characterized by needing a
      separate subunit - a cyclin - that provides domains essential for enzymatic
      activity. CDKs play important roles in the control of cell division and modulate 
      transcription in response to several extra- and intracellular cues. The
      evolutionary expansion of the CDK family in mammals led to the division of CDKs
      into three cell-cycle-related subfamilies (Cdk1, Cdk4 and Cdk5) and five
      transcriptional subfamilies (Cdk7, Cdk8, Cdk9, Cdk11 and Cdk20). Unlike the
      prototypical Cdc28 kinase of budding yeast, most of these CDKs bind one or a few 
      cyclins, consistent with functional specialization during evolution. This review 
      summarizes how, although CDKs are traditionally separated into cell-cycle or
      transcriptional CDKs, these activities are frequently combined in many family
      members. Not surprisingly, deregulation of this family of proteins is a hallmark 
      of several diseases, including cancer, and drug-targeted inhibition of specific
      members has generated very encouraging results in clinical trials.

TI  - Selective inhibition of CDK7 ameliorates experimental arthritis in mice.
PG  - 269-75
LID - 10.1007/s10238-014-0305-6 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have emerged as anti-inflammatory targets. The
      purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects of a selective CDK7 
      inhibitor, BS-181, on mice with established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA
      mice were administered intraperitoneally with BS-181 (10 mg/kg) twice daily for 2
      weeks. Control mice received vehicle only. Arthritis severity and joint
      histopathology were examined. The proinflammatory cytokines and anti-type II
      collagen antibodies (anti-CII) were determined by ELISA. IkB kinase
      (IKK)-beta/NF-kappaB activation in the arthritic joints was assessed by Western
      blot. The ratio of Th17 cells was determined by flow cytometry. In vitro,
      splenocytes from mice with established CIA were stimulated with CII in the
      presence or absence of BS-181 and cytokines were detected. BS-181 treatment
      reduced the clinical score and histological damage in CIA mice. The serum
      proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta and IL-17) and anti-CII IgG2a levels
      were also decreased by BS-181 administration. Moreover, IKK-beta/NF-kappaB
      signaling pathway was inhibited in arthritic joints. BS-181 administration also
      decreased the ratio of Th17 cells. In addition, CIA splenocytes pretreated with
      BS-181 produced less proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. These findings indicate 
      that CDK7 inhibition by BS-181 is effective in the treatment of CIA, which might 
      be mediated by suppression of IKK-beta/NF-kappaB activation and Th17 cell
      response.

AB  - Histamine (Hia) is the most multifunctional biogenic amine. It is synthetized by 
      histidine decarboxylase (HDC) in a reduced set of mammalian cell types. Mast
      cells and histaminergic neurons store Hia in specialized organelles until the
      amine is extruded by exocytosis; however, other immune and cancer cells are able 
      to produce but not store Hia. The intracellular effects of Hia are still not well
      characterized, in spite of its physiopathological relevance. Multiple functional 
      relationships exist among Hia metabolism/signaling elements and those of other
      biogenic amines, including growth-related polyamines. Previously, we obtained the
      first insights for an inhibitory effect of newly synthetized Hia on both
      growth-related polyamine biosynthesis and cell cycle progression of non-fully
      differentiated mammalian cells. In this work, we describe progress in this line. 
      HEK293 cells were transfected to express active and inactive versions of
      GFP-human HDC fusion proteins and, after cell sorting by flow cytometry, the
      relative expression of a large number of proteins associated with cell signaling 
      were measured using an antibody microarray. Experimental results were analyzed in
      terms of protein-protein and functional interaction networks. Expression of
      active HDC induced a cell cycle arrest through the alteration of the levels of
      several proteins such as cyclin D1, cdk6, cdk7 and cyclin A. Regulation of
      alpha-synuclein and caspase-3 was also observed. The analyses provide new clues
      on the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory effects of intracellular
      newly synthetized Hia on cell proliferation/survival, cell trafficking and
      protein turnover. This information is especially interesting for emergent and
      orphan immune and neuroinflammatory diseases.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 controls mRNA synthesis by affecting stability of
      preinitiation complexes, leading to altered gene expression, cell cycle
      progression, and survival of tumor cells.
PG  - 3675-88

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) activates cell cycle CDKs and is a member of the
      general transcription factor TFIIH. Although there is substantial evidence for an
      active role of CDK7 in mRNA synthesis and associated processes, the degree of its
      influence on global and gene-specific transcription in mammalian species is
      unclear. In the current study, we utilize two novel inhibitors with high
      specificity for CDK7 to demonstrate a restricted but robust impact of CDK7 on
      gene transcription in vivo and in in vitro-reconstituted reactions. We
      distinguish between relative low- and high-dose responses and relate them to
      distinct molecular mechanisms and altered physiological responses. Low inhibitor 
      doses cause rapid clearance of paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) molecules and
      sufficed to cause genome-wide alterations in gene expression, delays in cell
      cycle progression at both the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints, and diminished survival 
      of human tumor cells. Higher doses and prolonged inhibition led to strong
      reductions in RNAPII carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation, eventual
      activation of the p53 program, and increased cell death. Together, our data
      reason for a quantitative contribution of CDK7 to mRNA synthesis, which is
      critical for cellular homeostasis.

TI  - Targeting transcription regulation in cancer with a covalent CDK7 inhibitor.
PG  - 616-20
LID - 10.1038/nature13393 [doi]
AB  - Tumour oncogenes include transcription factors that co-opt the general
      transcriptional machinery to sustain the oncogenic state, but direct
      pharmacological inhibition of transcription factors has so far proven difficult. 
      However, the transcriptional machinery contains various enzymatic cofactors that 
      can be targeted for the development of new therapeutic candidates, including
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Here we present the discovery and
      characterization of a covalent CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, which has the unprecedented 
      ability to target a remote cysteine residue located outside of the canonical
      kinase domain, providing an unanticipated means of achieving selectivity for
      CDK7. Cancer cell-line profiling indicates that a subset of cancer cell lines,
      including human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), have exceptional
      sensitivity to THZ1. Genome-wide analysis in Jurkat T-ALL cells shows that THZ1
      disproportionally affects transcription of RUNX1 and suggests that sensitivity to
      THZ1 may be due to vulnerability conferred by the RUNX1 super-enhancer and the
      key role of RUNX1 in the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of these
      tumour cells. Pharmacological modulation of CDK7 kinase activity may thus provide
      an approach to identify and treat tumour types that are dependent on
      transcription for maintenance of the oncogenic state.

TI  - Modifiers of (CAG)(n) instability in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3)
      transmissions: an association study with DNA replication, repair and
      recombination genes.
PG  - 1311-8
LID - 10.1007/s00439-014-1467-8 [doi]
AB  - Twelve neurological disorders are caused by gene-specific CAG/CTG repeat
      expansions that are highly unstable upon transmission to offspring. This
      intergenerational repeat instability is clinically relevant since disease onset, 
      progression and severity are associated with repeat size. Studies of model
      organisms revealed the involvement of some DNA replication and repair genes in
      the process of repeat instability, however, little is known about their role in
      patients. Here, we used an association study to search for genetic modifiers of
      (CAG)n instability in 137 parent-child transmissions in Machado-Joseph disease
      (MJD/SCA3). With the hypothesis that variants in genes involved in DNA
      replication, repair or recombination might alter the MJD CAG instability
      patterns, we screened 768 SNPs from 93 of these genes. We found a variant in
      ERCC6 (rs2228528) associated with an expansion bias of MJD alleles. When using a 
      gene-gene interaction model, the allele combination G-A (rs4140804-rs2972388) of 
      RPA3-CDK7 is also associated with MJD instability in a direction-dependent
      manner. Interestingly, the transcription-coupled repair factor ERCC6 (aka CSB),
      the single-strand binding protein RPA, and the CDK7 kinase part of the TFIIH
      transcription repair complex, have all been linked to transcription-coupled
      repair. This is the first study performed in patient samples to implicate
      specific modifiers of CAG instability in humans. In summary, we found variants in
      three transcription-coupled repair genes associated with the MJD mutation that
      points to distinct mechanisms of (CAG)n instability.

TI  - Nucleotide excision repair/transcription gene defects in the fetus and impaired
      TFIIH-mediated function in transcription in placenta leading to preeclampsia.
PG  - 373
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-15-373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a significant cause of maternal and fetal mortality
      and morbidity worldwide. We previously reported associations between
      trichothiodystrophy (TTD) nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription gene
      mutations in the fetus and the risk of gestational complications including
      preeclampsia. TTD NER/transcription genes, XPD, XPB and TTD-A, code for subunits 
      of Transcription Factor (TF)IIH. Interpreting XPD mutations in the context of
      available biochemical data led us to propose adverse effects on CDK-activating
      kinase (CAK) subunit of TFIIH and TFIIH-mediated functions as a relevant
      mechanism in preeclampsia. In order to gain deeper insight into the underlying
      biologic mechanisms involving TFIIH-mediated functions in placenta, we analyzed
      NER/transcription and global gene expression profiles of normal and preeclamptic 
      placentas and studied gene regulatory networks. RESULTS: We found high expression
      of TTD NER/transcription genes in normal human placenta, above the mean of their 
      expression in all organs. XPD and XPB were consistently expressed from 14 to 40
      weeks gestation while expression of TTD-A was strongly negatively correlated
      (r=-0.7, P<0.0001) with gestational age. Analysis of gene expression patterns of 
      placentas from a case-control study of preeclampsia using Algorithm for
      Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNE) revealed GTF2E1, a
      component of TFIIE which modulates TFIIH, among major regulators of
      differentially-expressed genes in preeclampsia. The basal transcription pathway
      was among the largest dysregulated protein-protein interaction networks in this
      preeclampsia dataset. Within the basal transcription pathway, significantly
      down-regulated genes besides GTF2E1 included those coding for the CAK complex of 
      TFIIH, namely CDK7, CCNH, and MNAT1. Analysis of other relevant gene expression
      and gene regulatory network data also underscored the involvement of
      transcription pathways and identified JUNB and JUND (components of transcription 
      factor AP-1) as transcription regulators of the network involving the TTD genes, 
      GTF2E1, and selected gene regulators implicated in preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results indicate that TTD NER/transcription genes are expressed in placenta
      during gestational periods critical to preeclampsia development. Our overall
      findings suggest that impairment of TFIIH-mediated function in transcription in
      placenta is a likely mechanism leading to preeclampsia and provide etiologic
      clues which may be translated into therapeutic and preventive measures.

TI  - The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor SNS-032 induces apoptosis in breast cancer 
      cells via depletion of Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and
      displays antitumor activity in vivo.
PG  - 804-12
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2014.2467 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) have been reported to have
      activities in many types of cancer cells by inhibiting Cdk7 and Cdk9, which
      control transcription. SNS-032 is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk2, Cdk7 
      and Cdk9 and has emerged in clinical trials. Here, we examined the viability of
      MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells in the presence of SNS-032 and observed 
      a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation in both cell lines. SNS-032
      had a direct apoptosis-inducing effect through both the extrinsic and intrinsic
      apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cells as shown by a dose-dependent increase
      in Annexin V-positive cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
      dUTP nick?end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, as well as activation of
      caspase-8, -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). At the molecular level,
      SNS-032 induced a marked dephosphorylation of serine 2 and 5 of RNA polymerase
      (RNA Pol) II and blocked RNA synthesis. Consistent with the inherently rapid
      turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins, the anti-apoptotic proteins
      Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) were rapidly reduced on 
      exposure to SNS-032. Our results also indicated that SNS-032 suppressed the
      growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. These data demonstrate that the use
      of SNS-032 may be a rational and novel therapeutic strategy for human breast
      cancer and warrants further clinical investigation.

TI  - Flavonoids from tartary buckwheat induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
      human hepatoma HepG2 cells.
PG  - 460-70
LID - 10.1093/abbs/gmu023 [doi]
AB  - The cytotoxicity and antioxidant activity on human hepatoma cell line HepG2 of
      three flavonoids homogenous compounds from tartary buckwheat seeds and bran,
      namely quercetin, isoquercetin, and rutin, were investigated. The total
      antioxidant competency detection results indicated that the antioxidant capacity 
      of quercetin was the strongest in a biological response system. A
      [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay showed that 
      quercetin exhibited the strongest cytotoxic effects against the HepG2 cell line. 
      Flow cytometric analysis indicated that quercetin significantly increased the
      production of reactive oxygen species, and led to the G2/M phase arrest
      accompanied by an increase of apoptotic cell death after 48 h of incubation.
      Quercetin-induced cell apoptosis was shown to involve p53 and p21 up-regulation, 
      Cyclin D1, Cdk2, and Cdk7 down-regulation. These results suggested that the
      induction of G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and cell death by quercetin may associate
      with increased expression of p53 and p21, decrease of Cyclin D1, Cdk2, and Cdk7
      levels, and generation of reactive oxygen species in cells. This study will help 
      to better understand and fully utilize medicinal resources of plant flavonoids.

TI  - Systems analysis utilising pathway interactions identifies sonic hedgehog pathway
      as a primary biomarker and oncogenic target in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 243-51
AB  - The development and progression of cancer is associated with disruption of
      biological networks. Historically studies have identified sets of signature genes
      involved in events ultimately leading to the development of cancer.
      Identification of such sets does not indicate which biologic processes are
      oncogenic drivers and makes it difficult to identify key networks to target for
      interventions. Using a comprehensive, integrated computational approach, the
      authors identify the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway as the gene network that most
      significantly distinguishes tumour and tumour-adjacent samples in human
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The analysis reveals that the SHH pathway is
      commonly activated in the tumour samples and its activity most significantly
      differentiates tumour from the non-tumour samples. The authors experimentally
      validate these in silico findings in the same biologic material using Western
      blot analysis. This analysis reveals that the expression levels of SHH,
      phosphorylated cyclin B1, and CDK7 levels are much higher in most tumour tissues 
      as compared to normal tissue. It is also shown that siRNA-mediated silencing of
      SHH gene expression resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation in 
      a liver cancer cell line, SNU449 indicating that SHH plays a major role in
      promoting cell proliferation in liver cancer. The SHH pathway is a key network
      underpinning HCC aetiology which may guide the development of interventions for
      this most common form of human liver cancer.

TI  - Kin28 regulates the transient association of Mediator with core promoters.
PG  - 449-55
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2810 [doi]
AB  - Mediator is an essential, broadly used eukaryotic transcriptional coactivator.
      How and what Mediator communicates from activators to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) 
      remains an open question. Here we performed genome-wide location profiling of
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator subunits. Mediator is not found at core
      promoters but rather occupies the upstream activating sequence, upstream of the
      pre-initiation complex. In the absence of Kin28 (CDK7) kinase activity or in
      cells in which the RNAPII C-terminal domain is mutated to replace Ser5 with
      alanine, however, Mediator accumulates at core promoters together with RNAPII. We
      propose that Mediator is released quickly from promoters after phosphorylation of
      Ser5 by Kin28 (CDK7), which also allows for RNAPII to escape from the promoter.

PG  - 157-61
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.02.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of PD0332991 (C24H29N7O2) on cell cycle,
      apoptosis, differentiation and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in 
      mice. METHODS: The self renewal ability of HSCs was measured by cobblestone
      forming cell assay (CAFC). The colony-forming cell (CFC) assay was used to
      quantify the changes of numbers and functions of HPC after the treatment of the
      compound. The expressions of self-renewal regulation genes, cell cycle-related
      genes, apoptosis-related genes were measured by real-time PCR. The cell cycle
      status and apoptosis of HSC and HPC were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS:
      There were obvious changes in cell cycle regulation between control and PD0332991
      groups. HSCs in G1 phase increased significantly from 76.3% to 89.5% after
      treatment of PD0332991 (P<0.05) while cells in S, G2 and M phase reduced from
      20.5% to 7.3% (P<0.05). HPCs in G1 phase also increased from 74% to 87.4% after
      treatment of PD0332991 (P<0.05) while cells in S, G2 and M phase reduced from
      25.54% to 11.6% (P<0.05). The apoptotic fractions between control and PD0332991
      groups had no statistical difference (P>0.05). After cultured with PD0332991, the
      expression levels of cell cycle genes CDK1, CyclinA2, CyclinF, p18, p19 and p27
      decreased by 58.77%, 66.35%, 56.33%, 62.18%, 32.28% and 36.53% respectively,
      while expression of CDK7 increased by 27.27% (P<0.05). No visible expression
      difference was observed in apoptosis and self-renew related genes. After
      treatment of PD0332991, the self-renewal ability of HSC decreased significantly. 
      There were almost no CFCs in PD0332991 group in CAFC assay. Similarly, the
      frequency of CFCs was dramatically lower in PD0332991 group. CONCLUSION: These
      results suggested that PD0332991 affected HSC/HPC from mice mainly through
      inhibiting the cell cycle rather than apoptosis. It also suggested that CDK4/6
      might play a key role in the regulation of HSC/HPC.

      implication in anti-viral therapy.
PG  - e89228
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0089228 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulators of the cell cycle and RNA
      polymerase II mediated transcription. Several pharmacological CDK inhibitors are 
      currently in clinical trials as potential cancer therapeutics and some of them
      also exhibit antiviral effects. Olomoucine II and roscovitine, purine-based
      inhibitors of CDKs, were described as effective antiviral agents that inhibit
      replication of a broad range of wild type human viruses. Olomoucine II and
      roscovitine show high selectivity for CDK7 and CDK9, with important functions in 
      the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription. RNA polymerase II is necessary
      for viral transcription and following replication in cells. We analyzed the
      effect of inhibition of CDKs by olomoucine II on gene expression from viral
      promoters and compared its effect to widely-used roscovitine. We found that both 
      roscovitine and olomoucine II blocked the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II
      C-terminal domain. However the repression of genes regulated by viral promoters
      was strongly dependent on gene localization. Both roscovitine and olomoucine II
      inhibited expression only when the viral promoter was not integrated into
      chromosomal DNA. In contrast, treatment of cells with genome-integrated viral
      promoters increased their expression even though there was decreased
      phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. To define the
      mechanism responsible for decreased gene expression after pharmacological CDK
      inhibitor treatment, the level of mRNA transcription from extrachromosomal DNA
      was determined. Interestingly, our results showed that inhibition of RNA
      polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphorylation increased the number of
      transcribed mRNAs. However, some of these mRNAs were truncated and lacked
      polyadenylation, which resulted in decreased translation. These results suggest
      that phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain is critical for
      linking transcription and posttrancriptional processing of mRNA expressed from
      extrachromosomal DNA.

TI  - Toona Sinensis and Moschus Decoction Induced Cell Cycle Arrest in Human Cervical 
      Carcinoma HeLa Cells.

LID - 10.1155/2014/121276 [doi]
AB  - Toona sinensis and Moschus are two herb materials used in traditional Chinese
      medicine, most commonly for their various biological activities. In this study,
      we investigated the inhibitory effect of three decoctions from Toona sinensis,
      Moschus, and Toona sinensis and Moschus in combination on cell growth in several 
      normal and cancer cell lines by cell viability assay. The results showed that the
      combined decoction exhibited the strongest anticancer effects, compared to two
      single decoctions. The observations indicated that the combined decoction did not
      induce cell apoptosis and autophagy in HeLa cells by fluorescence microscopy.
      Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the combined decoction arrested HeLa cell
      cycle progression in S-phase. After the decoction incubation, among 41 cell cycle
      related genes, eight were reduced, while five were increased in mRNA levels by
      real-time PCR assay. Western blotting showed that there were no apparent changes 
      of protein levels of Cyclin E1, while P27 expression significantly declined and
      the levels of CDC7 and CDK7 obviously increased. The data suggest that the RB
      pathway is partially responsible for the decoction-induced S-phase cell cycle
      arrest in HeLa cells. Therefore, the combined decoction may have therapeutic
      potential as an anticancer formula for certain cancers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chromosomal abnormalities and poor quality are correlated with DNA
      damage in the pre-implantation stage in humans. This study aimed to explore the
      altered expression of DNA damage signalling pathways - including apoptosis, cell 
      cycle and DNA repair pathways - in poor-quality pre-implantation human embryos
      with complex aneuploidy. STUDY DESIGN: Surplus Day 4 embryos from candidates
      undergoing pre-implantation genetic screening were pooled into two groups. Group 
      1 included good-quality embryos that had simple aneuploidy, a single chromosome
      [according to fluorescence in situ hybridization-based pre-implantation genetic
      diagnosis (PGD) on Day 3], a normal rate of cell division, and graded as A or B
      (excellent to good). Group 2 included embryos with more than one aneuploid
      chromosome on PGD on Day 3, an abnormal rate of cell division, and graded as C or
      D (fair to poor). Gene expression of DNA damage signalling pathways was analysed 
      using a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based array, which included 84 genes 
      after specific pre-amplification of cDNA by a primer mix, including all array
      genes. RESULTS: In Group 2, five of the 84 genes studied showed significant
      overexpression (p<0.05): MSH3, XRCC1, RAD50, LIG1 and CDK7. Alterations were in
      agreement with genetic relationships in pathway analyses on DAVID. CONCLUSIONS:
      The five overexpressed genes are involved in DNA repair. Therefore, in comparison
      with cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways, DNA repair pathways are more
      activated in poor-quality pre-implantation human embryos with complex aneuploidy.
      This suggests that the dominant response to DNA damage in such embryos is DNA
      repair rather than cell division or apoptosis.

      cancers. Impairment of the DNA repair mechanism has been associated with
      arsenic-induced genetic damage as well as with several cancers. ERCC2 (Excision
      Repair Cross-Complementing rodent repair, complementation group 2), mediates
      DNA-repair by interacting with Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which helps
      in DNA proof-reading during transcription. Arsenic metabolism alters epigenetic
      regulation; we tried to elucidate the regulation of ERCC2 in arsenic-exposed
      humans. Water, urine, nails, hair and blood samples from one hundred and fifty
      seven exposed and eighty eight unexposed individuals were collected. Dose
      dependent validation was done in vitro using HepG2 and HEK-293. Arsenic content
      in the biological samples was higher in the exposed individuals compared with the
      content in unexposed individuals (p < 0.001). Bisulfite-modified methylation
      specific PCR showed a significant (p < 0.0001) hypomethylation of the ERCC2
      promoter in the arsenic-exposed individuals. Densitometric analysis of
      immunoblots showed a nearly two-fold increase in expression of ERCC2 in exposed
      individuals, but there was an enhanced genotoxic insult as measured by
      micronuclei frequency. Immuno-precipitation and western blotting revealed an
      increased (p < 0.001) association of Cdk7 with ERCC2 in highly arsenic exposed
      individuals. The decrease in CAK activity was determined by observing the
      intensity of Ser(392) phosphorylation in p53, in vitro, which decreased with an
      increase in arsenic dose. Thus we infer that arsenic biotransformation leads to
      promoter hypomethylation of ERCC2, which in turn inhibits the normal functioning 
      of the CAK-complex, thus affecting DNA-repair; this effect was highest among the 
      arsenic exposed individuals with dermatological lesions.

AB  - Novel treatment options are needed for the successful therapy of patients with
      high-risk neuroblastoma. Here, we investigated the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 
      inhibitor SNS-032 in a panel of 109 neuroblastoma cell lines consisting of 19
      parental cell lines and 90 sublines with acquired resistance to 14 different
      anticancer drugs. Seventy-three percent of the investigated neuroblastoma cell
      lines and all four investigated primary tumor samples displayed concentrations
      that reduce cell viability by 50% in the range of the therapeutic plasma levels
      reported for SNS-032 (<754 nM). Sixty-two percent of the cell lines and two of
      the primary samples displayed concentrations that reduce cell viability by 90% in
      this concentration range. SNS-032 also impaired the growth of the
      multidrug-resistant cisplatin-adapted UKF-NB-3 subline UKF-NB-3(r)CDDP(1000) in
      mice. ABCB1 expression (but not ABCG2 expression) conferred resistance to
      SNS-032. The antineuroblastoma effects of SNS-032 did not depend on functional
      p53. The antineuroblastoma mechanism of SNS-032 included CDK7 and CDK9
      inhibition-mediated suppression of RNA synthesis and subsequent depletion of
      antiapoptotic proteins with a fast turnover rate including X-linked inhibitor of 
      apoptosis (XIAP), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), baculoviral IAP
      repeat containing 2 (BIRC2; cIAP-1), and survivin. In conclusion, CDK7 and CDK9
      represent promising drug targets and SNS-032 represents a potential treatment
      option for neuroblastoma including therapy-refractory cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular history of animal evolution from single-celled
      ancestors remains a major question in biology, and little is known regarding the 
      evolution of cell cycle regulation during animal emergence. In this study, we
      conducted a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of CDK and cyclin proteins in
      metazoans and their unicellular relatives. RESULTS: Our analysis divided the CDK 
      family into eight subfamilies. Seven subfamilies (CDK1/2/3, CDK5, CDK7, CDK 20,
      CDK8/19, CDK9, and CDK10/11) are conserved in metazoans and fungi, with the
      remaining subfamily, CDK4/6, found only in eumetazoans. With respect to cyclins, 
      cyclin C, H, L, Y subfamilies, and cyclin K and T as a whole subfamily, are
      generally conserved in animal, fungi, and amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. In
      contrast, cyclin subfamilies B, A, E, and D, which are cell cycle-related, have
      distinct evolutionary histories. The cyclin B subfamily is generally conserved in
      D. discoideum, fungi, and animals, whereas cyclin A and E subfamilies are both
      present in animals and their unicellular relatives such as choanoflagellate
      Monosiga brevicollis and filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki, but are absent in
      fungi and D. discoideum. Although absent in fungi and D. discoideum, cyclin D
      subfamily orthologs can be found in the early-emerging, non-opisthokont apusozoan
      Thecamonas trahens. Within opisthokonta, the cyclin D subfamily is conserved only
      in eumetazoans, and is absent in fungi, choanoflagellates, and the basal metazoan
      Amphimedon queenslandica. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the CDK4/6
      subfamily and eumetazoans emerged simultaneously, with the evolutionary
      conservation of the cyclin D subfamily also tightly linked with eumetazoan
      appearance. Establishment of the CDK4/6-cyclin D complex may have been the key
      step in the evolution of cell cycle control during eumetazoan emergence.

AB  - The mitochondrial outer membrane is a major site of apoptosis regulation across
      phyla. Human and C. elegans Bcl-2 family proteins and Drosophila Hid require the 
      C-terminal tail-anchored (TA) sequence in order to insert into the mitochondrial 
      membrane, but it remains unclear whether cytosolic proteins actively regulate the
      mitochondrial localization of these proteins. Here, we report that the cdk7
      complex regulates the mitochondrial localization of Hid and its ability to induce
      apoptosis. We identified cdk7 through an in vivo RNAi screen of genes required
      for cell death. Although CDK7 is best known for its role in transcription and
      cell-cycle progression, a hypomorphic cdk7 mutant suppressed apoptosis without
      impairing these other known functions. In this cdk7 mutant background, Hid failed
      to localize to the mitochondria and failed to bind to recombinant inhibitors of
      apoptosis (IAPs). These findings indicate that apoptosis is promoted by a newly
      identified function of CDK7, which couples the mitochondrial localization and IAP
      binding of Hid.

TI  - CDK/CK1 inhibitors roscovitine and CR8 downregulate amplified MYCN in
      neuroblastoma cells.
PG  - 5675-87
LID - 10.1038/onc.2013.513 [doi]
AB  - To understand the mechanisms of action of (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8, two
      related pharmacological inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), we applied
      a variety of '-omics' techniques to the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and IMR32
      cell lines: (1) kinase interaction assays, (2) affinity competition on
      immobilized broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors, (3) affinity chromatography on
      immobilized (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8, (4) whole genome transcriptomics
      analysis and specific quantitative PCR studies, (5) global quantitative
      proteomics approach and western blot analysis of selected proteins. Altogether,
      the results show that the major direct targets of these two molecules belong to
      the CDKs (1,2,5,7,9,12), DYRKs, CLKs and CK1s families. By inhibiting CDK7, CDK9 
      and CDK12, these inhibitors transiently reduce RNA polymerase 2 activity, which
      results in downregulation of a large set of genes. Global transcriptomics and
      proteomics analysis converge to a central role of MYC transcription factors
      downregulation. Indeed, CDK inhibitors trigger rapid and massive downregulation
      of MYCN expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells as well as in nude mice 
      xenografted IMR32 cells. Inhibition of casein kinase 1 may also contribute to the
      antitumoral activity of (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8. This dual mechanism of
      action may be crucial in the use of these kinase inhibitors for the treatment of 
      MYC-dependent cancers, in particular neuroblastoma where MYCN amplification is a 
      strong predictor factor for high-risk disease.

TI  - Acidic residue Glu199 increases SUMOylation level of nuclear hormone receptor
      NR5A1.
PG  - 22331-45
LID - 10.3390/ijms141122331 [doi]
AB  - Steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1/SF1) is a well-known master regulator in
      controlling adrenal and sexual development, as well as regulating numerous genes 
      involved in adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis. Several studies including ours
      have demonstrated that NR5A1 can be SUMOylated on lysine 194 (K194, the major
      site) and lysine 119 (K119, the minor site), and the cycle of SUMOylation
      regulates NR5A1's transcriptional activity. An extended consensus negatively
      charged amino acid-dependent SUMOylation motif (NDSM) enhances the specificity of
      substrate modification by SUMO has been reported; however, the mechanism of NDSM 
      for NR5A1 remains to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the functional 
      significance of the acidic residue located downstream from the core consensus
      SUMO site of NR5A1. Here we report that E199A (glutamic acid was replaced with
      alanine) of NR5A1 reduced, but not completely abolished, its SUMOylation level.
      We next characterized the functional role of NR5A1 E199A on target gene
      expression and protein levels. We found that E199A alone, as well as combination 
      with K194R, increased Mc2r and Cyp19a1 reporter activities. Moreover, E199A alone
      as well as combination with K194R enhanced NR5A1-mediated STAR protein levels in 
      mouse adrenocortical cancer Y1 cells. We also observed that E199A increased
      interaction of NR5A1 with CDK7 and SRC1. Overall, we provide the evidence that
      the acidic residue (E199) located downstream from the core consensus SUMO site of
      NR5A1 is, at least in part, required for SUMOylation of NR5A1 and for its
      mediated target gene and protein expression.

TI  - A preliminary study of genes related to concomitant chemoradiotherapy resistance 
      in advanced uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 4109-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor intrinsic chemoradiotherapy resistance is the primary factor in
      concomitant chemoradiotherapy failure in advanced uterine cervical squamous cell 
      carcinoma. This study aims to identify a set of genes and molecular pathways
      related to this condition. METHODS: Forty patients with uterine cervical squamous
      cell carcinoma in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIb
      or IIIb, treated with platinum-based concomitant chemoradiotherapy between May
      2007 and December 2012, were enrolled in this trial. Patients included
      chemoradiotherapy resistant (n = 20) and sensitive (n = 20) groups. Total RNA was
      extracted from fresh tumor tissues obtained by biopsy before treatment and
      microarray analysis was performed to identify genes differentially expressed
      between the two groups. RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified 108 genes
      differentially expressed between concomitant chemoradiotherapy resistant and
      sensitive patients. Functional pathway cluster analysis of these genes revealed
      that DNA damage repair, apoptosis, cell cycle, Map kinase signal transduction,
      anaerobic glycolysis and glutathione metabolism were the most relevant pathways. 
      Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and protein kinase A type 
      1A (PRKAR1A) were significantly upregulated in the chemoradiosensitive group,
      while lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), bcl2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1),
      bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), single-strand-selective
      monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1), and cyclin-dependent kinase 7
      (CDK7) were upregulated in the chemoradiotherapy resistant group. CONCLUSION: We 
      have identified seven genes that are differentially expressed in concomitant
      chemoradiotherapy resistant and sensitive uterine cervical squamous cell
      carcinomas, which may represent primary predictors for this condition.

AB  - Three cyclin dependent kinases, Cdk7, Cdk8 and Cdk9 are intimately connected with
      the processes of RNA polymerase II dependent transcription initiation and
      elongation in eukaryotic cells. Each of these kinases is part of a larger
      multisubunit complex, TFIIH, Mediator and p-TEFb respectively. Of the three
      kinases, Cdk8 is the most complex given that it has been associated with both
      positive and negative effects on transcription via mechanisms that include
      regulation of transcription factor turnover, regulation of CTD phosphorylation
      and regulation of activator or repressor function. Furthermore, Cdk8 has emerged 
      as a key regulator of multiple transcriptional programs linked to nutrient/growth
      factor sensing and differentiation control. As such Cdk8 represents a potentially
      interesting therapeutic drug target. In this review we summarize the current
      state of knowledge on Cdk8 function both in yeast and higher eukaryotes as well
      as discussing the effects of Cdk8 null mutations at the organismal level.

TI  - ELL, a novel TFIIH partner, is involved in transcription restart after DNA
      repair.
PG  - 17927-32
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1305009110 [doi]
AB  - DNA lesions that block transcription may cause cell death even when repaired, if 
      transcription does not restart to reestablish cellular metabolism. However,
      transcription resumption after individual DNA-lesion repair remains poorly
      described in mechanistic terms and its players are largely unknown. The general
      transcription factor II H (TFIIH) is a major actor of both nucleotide excision
      repair subpathways of which transcription-coupled repair highlights the interplay
      between DNA repair and transcription. Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we
      have identified the protein eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) as a TFIIH
      partner. Here we show that ELL is recruited to UV-damaged chromatin in a Cdk7-
      dependent manner (a component of the cyclin-dependent activating kinase
      subcomplex of TFIIH). We demonstrate that depletion of ELL strongly hinders RNA
      polymerase II (RNA Pol II) transcription resumption after lesion removal and DNA 
      gap filling. Lack of ELL was also observed to increase RNA Pol II retention to
      the chromatin during this process. Identifying ELL as an essential player for RNA
      Pol II restart during cellular DNA damage response opens the way to obtaining a
      mechanistic description of transcription resumption after DNA repair.

PG  - 2356-67
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2013.584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control cell cycle progression, RNA
      transcription and apoptosis, making them attractive targets for anticancer drug
      development. Unfortunately, CDK inhibitors developed to date have demonstrated
      variable efficacy. METHODS: We generated drug-resistant cells by continuous
      low-dose exposure to a model pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine CDK inhibitor and
      investigated potential structural alterations for optimal efficacy. RESULTS: We
      identified induction of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCB1 and
      ABCG2, in resistant cells. Assessment of features involved in the ABC transporter
      substrate specificity from a compound library revealed high polar surface area
      (>100 A(2)) as a key determinant of transporter interaction. We developed
      ICEC-0782 that preferentially inhibited CDK2, CDK7 and CDK9 in the nanomolar
      range. The compound inhibited phosphorylation of CDK substrates and downregulated
      the short-lived proteins, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1. ICEC-0782 induced G2/M arrest and 
      apoptosis. The permeability and cytotoxicity of ICEC-0782 were unaffected by ABC 
      transporter expression. Following daily oral dosing, the compound inhibited
      growth of human colon HCT-116 and human breast MCF7 tumour xenografts in vivo by 
      84% and 94%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We identified a promising
      pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine compound devoid of ABC transporter interaction, highly 
      suitable for further preclinical and clinical evaluation for the treatment of
      cancer.

AB  - The lignan arctigenin (ARG) from the herb Arctium lappa L. possesses anti-cancer 
      activity, however the mechanism of action of ARG has been found to vary among
      tissues and types of cancer cells. The current study aims to gain insight into
      the ARG mediated mechanism of action involved in inhibiting proliferation and
      inducing apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells. This study also delineates the
      cancer cell specificity of ARG by comparison with its effects on various normal
      cell lines. ARG selectively arrested the proliferation of cancer cells at the
      G0/G1 phase through the down-regulation of NPAT protein expression. This
      down-regulation occurred via the suppression of either cyclin E/CDK2 or cyclin
      H/CDK7, while apoptosis was induced through the modulation of the Akt-1-related
      signaling pathway. Furthermore, a GSH synthase inhibitor specifically enhanced
      the cytotoxicity of ARG against cancer cells, suggesting that the intracellular
      GSH content was another factor influencing the susceptibility of cancer cells to 
      ARG. These findings suggest that specific cytotoxicity of ARG against lung cancer
      cells was explained by its selective modulation of the expression of NPAT, which 
      is involved in histone biosynthesis. The cytotoxicity of ARG appeared to be
      dependent on the intracellular GSH level.

TI  - The role of CCNH Val270Ala (rs2230641) and other nucleotide excision repair
      polymorphisms in individual susceptibility to well-differentiated thyroid cancer.
PG  - 2458-66
LID - 10.3892/or.2013.2702 [doi]
AB  - Well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common form of thyroid
      cancer (TC); however, with the exception of radiation exposure, its etiology
      remains largely unknown. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
      previously been implicated in DTC risk. Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
      polymorphisms, despite having been associated with cancer risk at other
      locations, have received little attention in the context of thyroid
      carcinogenesis. In order to evaluate the role of NER pathway SNPs in DTC
      susceptibility, we performed a case-control study in 106 Caucasian Portuguese DTC
      patients and 212 matched controls. rs2230641 (CCNH), rs2972388 (CDK7), rs1805329 
      (RAD23B), rs3212986 (ERCC1), rs1800067 (ERCC4), rs17655, rs2227869 (ERCC5),
      rs4253211 and rs2228529 (ERCC6) were genotyped using TaqMan(R) methodology, while
      conventional PCR-RFLP was employed for rs2228000 and rs2228001 (XPC). When
      considering all DTC cases, only rs2230641 (CCNH) was associated with DTC risk; a 
      consistent increase in overall DTC risk was observed for both the heterozygous
      genotype (OR=1.89, 95% CI=1.14-3.14) and the variant allele carriers (OR=1.79,
      95% CI=1.09-2.93). Histological stratification analysis confirmed an identical
      effect on follicular TC (OR=2.72, 95% CI=1.19-6.22, for heterozygous; OR=2.44,
      95% CI=1.075.55, for variant allele carriers). Considering papillary TC, the
      rs2228001 (XPC) variant genotype was associated with increased risk (OR=2.33, 95%
      CI=1.05-5.16), while a protective effect was observed for rs2227869 (ERCC5)
      (OR=0.26, 95% CI=0.080.90, for heterozygous; OR=0.25, 95% CI=0.07-0.86, for
      variant allele carriers). No further significant results were observed. Our
      results suggest that NER polymorphisms such as rs2230641 (CCNH) and, possibly,
      rs2227869 (ERCC5) and rs2228001 (XPC), may influence DTC susceptibility. However,
      larger studies are required to confirm these results.

AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the effect of SNS-032 (C17 H24 N4O2S2) on
      cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem
      cells (HSC) in mice. The self-renewal capability of bone marrow cells was
      measured by cobblestone forming cell test. The expressions of self-renewal
      regulation genes, cell cycle-related genes, apoptosis-related genes were measured
      by real-time PCR. The cell cycle status and apoptosis of HSC and HPC were
      detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that there was no significant
      difference of the frequency of HSC between SNS-032 and control group. The
      expressions of CDK1, CDK2, CDK7 and p27 decreased in HSC (P < 0.05) while the
      expressions of CDK4, CDK6, p21, p18, p19, Bcl-2, Bax, Puma, p53, Bim1, Sall4 and 
      Notch1 showed no difference between SNS-032 group and control group (P > 0.05).
      The fraction of viable HSC in each phase of cell cycle remained unchanged after
      the treatment of SNS-032 (P > 0.05). Furthermore, there was no statistical
      difference in the apoptotic fractions between control and drug-treated groups (P 
      > 0.05). It is concluded that SNS-032 induce apoptosis of cancer cells.
      Interestingly, SNS-032 has no significant inhibitory effect on self-renewal and
      differentiation of normal HSC, as well as no obvious effect inducing apoptosis of
      normal HSC and HPC.

TI  - C3orf58, a novel paracrine protein, stimulates cardiomyocyte cell-cycle
      progression through the PI3K-AKT-CDK7 pathway.
PG  - 372-80
LID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301075 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The regenerative capacity of the heart is markedly diminished shortly 
      after birth, coinciding with overall withdrawal of cardiomyocytes from cell
      cycle. Consequently, the adult mammalian heart has limited capacity to regenerate
      after injury. The discovery of factors that can induce cardiomyocyte
      proliferation is, therefore, of high interest and has been the focus of extensive
      investigation throughout the past years. OBJECTIVE: We have recently identified
      C3orf58 as a novel hypoxia and Akt induced stem cell factor (HASF) secreted from 
      mesenchymal stem cells, which can promote cardiac repair through cytoprotective
      mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HASF can also contribute to
      cardiac regeneration by stimulating cardiomyocyte division and proliferation.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes were stimulated in
      culture for 7 days with purified recombinant HASF protein. Compared with control 
      untreated cells, HASF-treated neonatal cardiomyocytes exhibited 60% increase in
      DNA synthesis as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. These results were 
      confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showing a 50% to 100%
      increase in the number of cardiomyocytes in the mitotic and cytokinesis phases.
      Importantly, in vivo cardiac overexpression of HASF in a transgenic mouse model
      resulted in enhanced level of DNA synthesis and cytokinesis in neonatal and adult
      cardiomyocytes. These proliferative effects were modulated by a phosphoinositide 
      3-kinase-protein kinase B-cycle-dependent kinase 7 pathway as revealed by the use
      of phosphoinositide 3-kinase -pathway-specific inhibitors and silencing of the
      Cdk7 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies support the hypothesis that HASF induces
      cardiomyocyte proliferation via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase
      B-cycle-dependent kinase 7 pathway. The implications of this finding may be
      significant for cardiac regeneration biology and therapeutics.

AB  - Resistance to cell death is a hallmark of cancer and renders transformed cells
      resistant to multiple apoptotic triggers. The Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, is a
      key driver of cell survival in diverse cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia 
      (AML). A screen for compounds that downregulate Mcl-1 identified the kinase
      inhibitor, PIK-75, which demonstrates marked proapoptotic activity against a
      panel of cytogenetically diverse primary human AML patient samples. We show that 
      PIK-75 transiently blocks Cdk7/9, leading to transcriptional suppression of
      MCL-1, rapid loss of Mcl-1 protein, and alleviation of its inhibition of
      proapoptotic Bak. PIK-75 also targets the p110alpha isoform of PI3K, which leads 
      to a loss of association between Bcl-xL and Bak. The simultaneous loss of Mcl-1
      and Bcl-xL association with Bak leads to rapid apoptosis of AML cells.
      Concordantly, low Bak expression in AML confers resistance to PIK-75-mediated
      killing. On the other hand, the induction of apoptosis by PIK-75 did not require 
      the expression of the BH3 proteins Bim, Bid, Bad, Noxa, or Puma. PIK-75
      significantly reduced leukemia burden and increased the survival of mice
      engrafted with human AML without inducing overt toxicity. Future efforts to
      cotarget PI3K and Cdk9 with drugs such as PIK-75 in AML are warranted.

TI  - CDK4 T172 phosphorylation is central in a CDK7-dependent bidirectional CDK4/CDK2 
      interplay mediated by p21 phosphorylation at the restriction point.
PG  - e1003546
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003546 [doi]
AB  - Cell cycle progression, including genome duplication, is orchestrated by
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK activation depends on phosphorylation of
      their T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the only known CAK for
      CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. Therefore, the
      critical activation step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc25
      phosphatases rather than unrestricted T-loop phosphorylation. Homologous CDK4 and
      CDK6 bound to cyclins D are master integrators of mitogenic/oncogenic signaling
      cascades by initiating the inactivation of the central oncosuppressor pRb and
      cell cycle commitment at the restriction point. Unlike the situation in CDK1 and 
      CDK2 cyclin complexes, and in contrast to the weak but constitutive T177
      phosphorylation of CDK6, we have identified the T-loop phosphorylation at T172 as
      the highly regulated step determining CDK4 activity. Whether both CDK4 and CDK6
      phosphorylations are catalyzed by CDK7 remains unclear. To answer this question, 
      we took a chemical-genetics approach by using analogue-sensitive CDK7(as/as)
      mutant HCT116 cells, in which CDK7 can be specifically inhibited by bulky adenine
      analogs. Intriguingly, CDK7 inhibition prevented activating phosphorylations of
      CDK4/6, but for CDK4 this was at least partly dependent on its binding to p21
      (cip1) . In response to CDK7 inhibition, p21-binding to CDK4 increased
      concomitantly with disappearance of the most abundant phosphorylation of p21,
      which we localized at S130 and found to be catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2. The
      S130A mutation of p21 prevented the activating CDK4 phosphorylation, and
      inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impaired phosphorylations of both p21 and p21-bound
      CDK4. Therefore, specific CDK7 inhibition revealed the following: a crucial but
      partly indirect CDK7 involvement in phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6; 
      existence of CDK4-activating kinase(s) other than CDK7; and novel CDK7-dependent 
      positive feedbacks mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2 to sustain
      CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage.

PG  - 723-38
LID - 10.1517/13543784.2013.789859 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate cell cycle progression.
      Certain CDKs (e.g., CDK7, CDK9) also control cellular transcription.
      Consequently, CDKs represent attractive targets for anticancer drug development, 
      as their aberrant expression is common in diverse malignancies, and CDK
      inhibition can trigger apoptosis. CDK inhibition may be particularly successful
      in hematologic malignancies, which are more sensitive to inhibition of cell
      cycling and apoptosis induction. AREAS COVERED: A number of CDK inhibitors,
      ranging from pan-CDK inhibitors such as flavopiridol (alvocidib) to highly
      selective inhibitors of specific CDKs (e.g., CDK4/6), such as PD0332991, that are
      currently in various phases of development, are profiled in this review.
      Flavopiridol induces cell cycle arrest, and globally represses transcription via 
      CDK9 inhibition. The latter may represent its major mechanism of action via
      down-regulation of multiple short-lived proteins. In early phase trials,
      flavopiridol has shown encouraging efficacy across a wide spectrum of hematologic
      malignancies. Early results with dinaciclib and PD0332991 also appear promising. 
      EXPERT OPINION: In general, the antitumor efficacy of CDK inhibitor monotherapy
      is modest, and rational combinations are being explored, including those
      involving other targeted agents. While selective CDK4/6 inhibition might be
      effective against certain malignancies, broad-spectrum CDK inhibition will likely
      be required for most cancers.

PG  - 731-8

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play essential roles in cell proliferation and
      gene expression. Although distinct sets of CDKs work in cell division and
      transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), they share a CDK-activating kinase
      (CAK), which is itself a CDK-Cdk7-in metazoans. Thus a unitary CDK network
      controls and may coordinate cycles of cell division and gene expression. Recent
      work reveals decisive roles for Cdk7 in both pathways. The CAK function of Cdk7
      helps determine timing of activation and cyclin-binding preferences of different 
      CDKs during the cell cycle. In the transcription cycle, Cdk7 is both an effector 
      kinase, which phosphorylates Pol II and other proteins and helps establish
      promoter-proximal pausing; and a CAK for Cdk9 (P-TEFb), which releases Pol II
      from the pause. By governing the transition from initiation to elongation, Cdk7, 
      Cdk9 and their substrates influence expression of genes important for
      developmental and cell-cycle decisions, and ensure co-transcriptional maturation 
      of Pol II transcripts. Cdk7 engaged in transcription also appears to be regulated
      by phosphorylation within its own activation (T) loop. Here I review recent
      studies of CDK regulation in cell division and gene expression, and propose a
      model whereby mitogenic signals trigger a cascade of CDK T-loop phosphorylation
      that drives cells past the restriction (R) point, when continued cell-cycle
      progression becomes growth factor-independent. Because R-point control is
      frequently deregulated in cancer, the CAK-CDK pathway is an attractive target for
      chemical inhibition aimed at impeding the inappropriate commitment to cell
      division.

AB  - Eukaryotic cell division is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which 
      require phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) for full activity.
      Chemical genetics uncovered requirements for the metazoan CAK Cdk7 in determining
      cyclin specificity and activation order of Cdk2 and Cdk1 during S and G2 phases. 
      It was unknown if Cdk7 also activates Cdk4 and Cdk6 to promote passage of the
      restriction (R) point, when continued cell-cycle progression becomes mitogen
      independent, or if CDK-activating phosphorylation regulates G1 progression. Here 
      we show that Cdk7 is a Cdk4- and Cdk6-activating kinase in human cells, required 
      to maintain activity, not just to establish the active state, as is the case for 
      Cdk1 and Cdk2. Activating phosphorylation of Cdk7 rises concurrently with that of
      Cdk4 as cells exit quiescence and accelerates Cdk4 activation in vitro.
      Therefore, mitogen signaling drives a CDK-activation cascade during G1
      progression, and CAK might be rate-limiting for R point passage.

      cells.

AB  - Transcription steps are marked by different modifications of the C-terminal
      domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Phosphorylation of Ser5 and Ser7 by
      cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) as part of TFIIH marks initiation, whereas
      phosphorylation of Ser2 by CDK9 marks elongation. These processes are thought to 
      take place in localized transcription foci in the nucleus, known as
      "transcription factories," but it has been argued that the observed clusters/foci
      are mere fixation or labeling artifacts. We show that transcription factories
      exist in living cells as distinct foci by live-imaging fluorescently labeled
      CDK9, a kinase known to associate with active RNAPII. These foci were observed in
      different cell types derived from CDK9-mCherry knock-in mice. We show that these 
      foci are very stable while highly dynamic in exchanging CDK9. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) data show that
      the genome-wide binding sites of CDK9 and initiating RNAPII overlap on
      transcribed genes. Immunostaining shows that CDK9-mCherry foci colocalize with
      RNAPII-Ser5P, much less with RNAPII-Ser2P, and not with CDK12 (a kinase reported 
      to be involved in the Ser2 phosphorylation) or with splicing factor SC35. In
      conclusion, transcription factories exist in living cells, and initiation and
      elongation of transcripts takes place in different nuclear compartments.

TI  - Extrapolating the effect of deleterious nsSNPs in the binding adaptability of
      flavopiridol with CDK7 protein: a molecular dynamics approach.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/1479-7364-7-10 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest the role of nonsynonymous single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) gene associated with
      defect in the DNA repair mechanism that may contribute to cancer risk. Among the 
      various inhibitors developed so far, flavopiridol proved to be a potential
      antitumor drug in the phase-III clinical trial for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 
      Here, we described a theoretical assessment for the discovery of new drugs or
      drug targets in CDK7 protein owing to the changes caused by deleterious nsSNPs.
      METHODS: Three nsSNPs (I63R, H135R, and T285M) were predicted to have functional 
      impact on protein function by SIFT, PolyPhen2, I-Mutant3, PANTHER, SNPs&GO,
      PhD-SNP, and screening for non-acceptable polymorphisms (SNAP). Furthermore, we
      analyzed the native and proposed mutant models in atomic level 10 ns simulation
      using the molecular dynamics (MD) approach. Finally, with the aid of Autodock 4.0
      and PatchDock, we analyzed the binding efficacy of flavopiridol with CDK7 protein
      with respect to the deleterious mutations. RESULTS: By comparing the results of
      all seven prediction tools, three nsSNPs (I63R, H135R, and T285M) were predicted 
      to have functional impact on the protein function. The results of protein
      stability analysis inferred that I63R and H135R exhibited less deviation in root 
      mean square deviation in comparison with the native and T285M protein. The
      flexibility of all the three mutant models of CDK7 protein is diverse in
      comparison with the native protein. Following to that, docking study revealed the
      change in the active site residues and decrease in the binding affinity of
      flavopiridol with mutant proteins. CONCLUSION: This theoretical approach is
      entirely based on computational methods, which has the ability to identify the
      disease-related SNPs in complex disorders by contrasting their costs and
      capabilities with those of the experimental methods. The identification of
      disease related SNPs by computational methods has the potential to create
      personalized tools for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases. LAY
      ABSTRACT: Cell cycle regulatory protein, CDK7, is linked with DNA repair
      mechanism which can contribute to cancer risk. The main aim of this study is to
      extrapolate the relationship between the nsSNPs and their effects in drug-binding
      capability. In this work, we propose a new methodology which (1) efficiently
      identified the deleterious nsSNPs that tend to have functional effect on protein 
      function upon mutation by computational tools, (2) analyze d the native protein
      and proposed mutant models in atomic level using MD approach, and (3)
      investigated the protein-ligand interactions to analyze the binding ability by
      docking analysis. This theoretical approach is entirely based on computational
      methods, which has the ability to identify the disease-related SNPs in complex
      disorders by contrasting their costs and capabilities with those of the
      experimental methods. Overall, this approach has the potential to create
      personalized tools for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases.

AB  - Conserved from yeast to mammals, phosphorylation of the heptad repeat sequence
      Tyr(1)-Ser(2)-Pro(3)-Thr(4)-Ser(5)-Pro(6)-Ser(7) in the carboxy-terminal domain
      (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) subunit, RPB1, mediates the
      enzyme's promoter escape and binding of RNA-processing factors, such as the m(7)G
      capping enzymes. The first critical step, Ser(5) phosphorylation, is carried out 
      by cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), a subunit of the basal transcription factor 
      TFIIH. Many early-diverged protists, such as the lethal human parasite
      Trypanosoma brucei, however, lack the heptad repeats and, apparently, a CDK7
      ortholog. Accordingly, characterization of trypanosome TFIIH did not identify a
      kinase component. The T. brucei CTD, however, is phosphorylated and essential for
      transcription. Here we show that silencing the expression of T. brucei
      cdc2-related kinase 9 (CRK9) leads to a loss of RPB1 phosphorylation.
      Surprisingly, this event did not impair RNA Pol II transcription or
      cotranscriptional m(7)G capping. Instead, we observed that CRK9 silencing led to 
      a block of spliced leader (SL) trans splicing, an essential step in trypanosome
      mRNA maturation, that was caused by hypomethylation of the SL RNA's unique cap4.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased expression of cyclinH (CCNH) and cyclin-dependent kinase 7 
      (CDK7) has a relationship with poor prognosis in most human cancers. AIM:
      Investigate the expression of CCNH and CDK7 in human esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma (ESCC) and the effect of chemotherapy on their expression. METHODS:
      Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to measure the expression of 
      CCNH and CDK7 proteins in ESCC and adjacent normal tissue in 98 patients. We use 
      Cell Counting Kit-8 and cell flow to analyze the effects of cisplatin and
      interference of CCNH and CDK7 in cell cycle process. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical
      analysis showed that CCNH and CDK7 expression were significantly associated with 
      unfavorable clinicopathologic variables. CCNH and CDK7 protein levels were
      elevated in ESCC tissues in comparison with adjacent normal tissues. Survival
      analysis revealed that CCNH and CDK7 overexpression were significantly associated
      with overall survival (P < 0.001). Cisplatin or interference of CCNH or CDK7 led 
      cells to grow slowly. Overexpression of CCNH and CDK7 in TE1 cells can lead to
      resistance to cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that CCNH and CDK7 may play
      an important role in the tumorigenesis and development of ESCC. CCNH and CDK7
      expression affected the chemotherapy of tumor.

LID - 10.3892/ijo.2013.1813 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 2-associated protein 1 (CDK2AP1), a growth suppressor
      that negatively regulates CDK2 activity, has been implicated in various types of 
      cancer; yet its role in lung cancer remains unclear. In the present study, a
      lentivirus-based system was used to specifically downregulate or upregulate
      CDK2AP1 expression. A549 lung cancer cells were treated with RNAi (RNA
      interference) or lentiviral vectors for overexpression. Ectopic overexpression of
      CDK2AP1 in A549 cells in vitro greatly impaired their proliferation and
      colony-forming ability and enhanced their chemosensitivity to cisplatin and
      paclitaxel and caused cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition accompanied by the
      reduction of expression of CDK4 and CDK7. Injection of the ectopically
      CDK2AP1-overexpressing A549 cells into nude mice resulted in growth arrest of
      solid lung cancer tumors in vivo. Knockdown of CDK2AP1 in A549 cells, however,
      gave rise to the opposite effects including promoting cell proliferation/growth, 
      cell cycling in vitro and enhancing tumorigenesis in vivo. These results suggest 
      that CDK2AP1 plays an important role in modulating the growth and tumorigenesis
      of lung cancer cells and also has significant effects on the chemosensitivity of 
      pulmonary malignancies to chemotherapeutics. Hence, this study extends our
      knowledge on the relationship between CDK2AP1 and oncogenesis of lung cancer,
      indicating that CDK2AP1 may serve as a new molecular target for future lung
      cancer therapy.

      pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic factors compete for fine-tuning CtBP2 levels
      is incompletely understood. Here we report that the cyclin H/cyclin-dependent
      kinase 7 (CCNH/CDK7) complex interacted with CtBP2 in vivo and in vitro.
      Depletion of either CCNH or CDK7 decreased CtBP2 protein levels by accelerating
      proteasome-dependent CtBP2 clearance. Further analysis revealed that CCNH/CDK7
      competed with the tumor repressor HIPK2 for CtBP2 binding and consequently
      inhibited phosphorylation and dimerization of CtBP2. Phosphorylation-defective
      CtBP2 interacted more strongly with CCNH/CDK7 and was more resistant to
      degradation. Finally, overexpression of CtBP2 increased whereas depletion of
      CtBP2 dampened the invasive and migratory potential of breast cancer cells. CtBP2
      promoted the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in a CCNH-dependent
      manner. Taken together, our data have delineated a novel pathway that regulates
      CtBP2 stability, suggesting that targeting the CCNH/CDK7-CtBP2 axis may yield a
      viable anti-tumor strategy.

TI  - Characterization of three XPG-defective patients identifies three missense
      mutations that impair repair and transcription.
PG  - 1841-9
LID - 10.1038/jid.2013.54 [doi]
AB  - Only 16 XPG-defective patients with 20 different mutations have been described.
      The current hypothesis is that missense mutations impair repair (xeroderma
      pigmentosum (XP) symptoms), whereas truncating mutations impair both repair and
      transcription (XP and Cockayne syndrome (CS) symptoms). We identified three cell 
      lines of XPG-defective patients (XP40GO, XP72MA, and XP165MA). Patients'
      fibroblasts showed a reduced post-UVC cell survival. The reduced repair
      capability, assessed by host cell reactivation, could be complemented by XPG
      cDNA. XPG mRNA expression of XP165MA, XP72MA, and XP40GO was 83%, 97%, and 82.5%,
      respectively, compared with normal fibroblasts. XP165MA was homozygous for a
      p.G805R mutation; XP72MA and XP40GO were both compound heterozygous (p.W814S and 
      p.E727X, and p.L778P and p.Q150X, respectively). Allele-specific complementation 
      analysis of these five mutations revealed that p.L778P and p.W814S retained
      considerable residual repair activity. In line with the severe XP/CS phenotypes
      of XP72MA and XP165MA, even the missense mutations failed to interact with the
      transcription factor IIH subunits XPD and to some extent cdk7 in
      coimmunoprecipitation assays. Immunofluorescence techniques revealed that the
      mutations destabilized early recruitment of XP proteins to localized photodamage 
      and delayed their redistribution in vivo. Thus, we identified three XPG missense 
      mutations in the I-region of XPG that impaired repair and transcription and
      resulted in severe XP/CS.

TI  - Vps factors are required for efficient transcription elongation in budding yeast.
PG  - 829-51
LID - 10.1534/genetics.112.146308 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing evidence that certain Vacuolar protein sorting (Vps)
      proteins, factors that mediate vesicular protein trafficking, have additional
      roles in regulating transcription factors at the endosome. We found that yeast
      mutants lacking the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] kinase Vps34 or its
      associated protein kinase Vps15 display multiple phenotypes indicating impaired
      transcription elongation. These phenotypes include reduced mRNA production from
      long or G+C-rich coding sequences (CDS) without affecting the associated GAL1
      promoter activity, and a reduced rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) progression
      through lacZ CDS in vivo. Consistent with reported genetic interactions with
      mutations affecting the histone acetyltransferase complex NuA4, vps15Delta and
      vps34Delta mutations reduce NuA4 occupancy in certain transcribed CDS. vps15Delta
      and vps34Delta mutants also exhibit impaired localization of the induced GAL1
      gene to the nuclear periphery. We found unexpectedly that, similar to known
      transcription elongation factors, these and several other Vps factors can be
      cross-linked to the CDS of genes induced by Gcn4 or Gal4 in a manner dependent on
      transcriptional induction and stimulated by Cdk7/Kin28-dependent phosphorylation 
      of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). We also observed colocalization of a
      fraction of Vps15-GFP and Vps34-GFP with nuclear pores at nucleus-vacuole (NV)
      junctions in live cells. These findings suggest that Vps factors enhance the
      efficiency of transcription elongation in a manner involving their physical
      proximity to nuclear pores and transcribed chromatin.

TI  - Cell cycle-related kinase in carcinogenesis.
PG  - 601-606
AB  - Cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) is a novel protein kinase homologous to both
      cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) and Cak1p groups of CDK-activating kinase (CAK).
      CCRK activates Cdk2, which controls the cell-cycle progression by phosphorylating
      a threonine residue conserved in Cdk2. Previous studies have indicated that the
      CCRK protein levels were elevated by more than 1.5-fold in tumor tissue, and that
      the overexpression of CCRK is associated with poor prognosis of the patients.
      Moreover, recent studies have shown that CCRK is involved in the Wnt signaling
      pathway associated with the genesis and evolution of cancer. This review aims to 
      systematically present the information currently available on CCRK obtained from 
      in vitro and in vivo studies and highlight its significance to tumorigenesis.

TI  - Antifibrotic effects of roscovitine in normal and scleroderma fibroblasts.
PG  - e48560
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0048560 [doi]
AB  - Heightened production of collagen and other matrix proteins underlies the
      fibrotic phenotype of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Roscovitine is an inhibitor of
      cyclin-dependent kinases that promote cell cycling (CDK1, 2), neuronal
      development (CDK5) and control transcription (CDK7,9). In an in vivo
      glomerulonephritis model, roscovitine treatment decreased mesangial cell
      proliferation and matrix proteins [1]. We investigated whether roscovitine could 
      regulate fibrotic protein production directly rather than through cell cycling.
      Our investigations revealed that roscovitine coordinately inhibited the
      expression of collagen, fibronectin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)
      in normal and SSc fibroblasts. This effect occurred on a transcriptional basis
      and did not result from roscovitine-mediated cell cycle inhibition.
      Roscovitine-mediated suppression of matrix proteins could not be reversed by the 
      exogenous profibrotic cytokines TGF-beta or IL-6. To our knowledge, we are the
      first to report that roscovitine modulates matrix protein transcription.
      Roscovitine may thus be a viable treatment option for SSc and other fibrosing
      diseases.

AB  - Molecular cytogenetic evaluation of human osteosarcoma (OS) has revealed the
      characteristically high degree of genomic reorganization that is the hallmark of 
      this cancer. The extent of genomic disorder in OS has hindered identification of 
      the genomic aberrations driving disease progression. With pathophysiological
      similarities to its human counterpart, canine OS represents an ideal model for
      comparison of conserved regions of genomic instability that may be
      disease-associated rather than genomic passengers. This study used
      high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization and a
      variety of informatics tools to aid in the identification of disease-associated
      genome-wide DNA copy number aberrations in canine and human OS. Our findings
      support and build upon the high level of cytogenetic complexity, through the
      identification of shared regions of microaberration (<500 kb) and functional
      analysis of possible orthologous OS-associated genes to pinpoint the cellular
      processes most commonly affected by aberration in human and canine OS. Aberrant
      regions contained previously reported genes such as CDC5L, MYC, RUNX2, and
      CDKN2A/CDKN2B, while expanding the gene of interest list to include ADAM15, CTC1,
      MEN1, CDK7, and others. Such regions of instability may thus have functional
      significance in the etiology of OS, the most common primary bone tumor in both
      species.

AB  - Promoter-proximal pausing by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) ensures gene-specific
      regulation and RNA quality control. Structural considerations suggested a
      requirement for initiation-factor eviction in elongation-factor engagement and
      pausing of transcription complexes. Here we show that selective inhibition of
      Cdk7--part of TFIIH--increases TFIIE retention, prevents DRB sensitivity-inducing
      factor (DSIF) recruitment and attenuates pausing in human cells. Pause release
      depends on Cdk9-cyclin T1 (P-TEFb); Cdk7 is also required for Cdk9-activating
      phosphorylation and Cdk9-dependent downstream events--Pol II C-terminal domain
      Ser2 phosphorylation and histone H2B ubiquitylation--in vivo. Cdk7 inhibition,
      moreover, impairs Pol II transcript 3'-end formation. Cdk7 thus acts through
      TFIIE and DSIF to establish, and through P-TEFb to relieve, barriers to
      elongation: incoherent feedforward that might create a window to recruit
      RNA-processing machinery. Therefore, cyclin-dependent kinases govern Pol II
      handoff from initiation to elongation factors and cotranscriptional RNA
      maturation.

AB  - Development of a fertilized human egg into an average sized adult requires about 
      29 trillion cell divisions, thereby producing enough DNA to stretch to the Sun
      and back 200 times (DePamphilis and Bell, 2011)! Even more amazing is the fact
      that throughout these mitotic cell cycles, the human genome is duplicated once
      and only once each time a cell divides. If a cell accidentally begins to
      re-replicate its nuclear DNA prior to cell division, checkpoint pathways trigger 
      apoptosis. And yet, some cells are developmentally programmed to respond to
      environmental cues by switching from mitotic cell cycles to endocycles, a process
      in which multiple S phases occur in the absence of either mitosis or cytokinesis.
      Endocycles allow production of viable, differentiated, polyploid cells that no
      longer proliferate. What is surprising is that among the 516 (Manning et al.,
      2002) to 557 (BioMart web site) protein kinases encoded by the human genome, only
      eight regulate nuclear DNA replication directly. These are Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4,
      Cdk6, Cdk7, Cdc7, Checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1), and Checkpoint kinase-2. Even more 
      remarkable is the fact that only four of these enzymes (Cdk1, Cdk7, Cdc7, and
      Chk1) are essential for mammalian development. Here we describe how these protein
      kinases determine when DNA replication occurs during mitotic cell cycles, how
      mammalian cells switch from mitotic cell cycles to endocycles, and how cancer
      cells can be selectively targeted for destruction by inducing them to begin a
      second S phase before mitosis is complete.

PG  - 38755-66
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.412015 [doi]
AB  - The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) serves as a docking site
      for numerous proteins, bridging various nuclear processes to transcription. The
      recruitment of these proteins is mediated by CTD phospho-epitopes generated
      during transcription. The mechanisms regulating the kinases that establish these 
      phosphorylation patterns on the CTD are not known. We report that three CTD
      kinases, CDK7, CDK9, and BRD4, engage in cross-talk, modulating their subsequent 
      CTD phosphorylation. BRD4 phosphorylates PTEFb/CDK9 at either Thr-29 or Thr-186, 
      depending on its relative abundance, which represses or activates CDK9 CTD kinase
      activity, respectively. Conversely, CDK9 phosphorylates BRD4 enhancing its CTD
      kinase activity. The CTD Ser-5 kinase CDK7 also interacts with and phosphorylates
      BRD4, potently inhibiting BRD4 kinase activity. Additionally, the three kinases
      regulate each other indirectly through the general transcription factor TAF7. An 
      inhibitor of CDK9 and CDK7 CTD kinase activities, TAF7 also binds to BRD4 and
      inhibits its kinase activity. Each of these kinases phosphorylates TAF7,
      affecting its subsequent ability to inhibit the other two. Thus, a complex
      regulatory network governs Pol II CTD kinases.

TI  - Natural product triptolide mediates cancer cell death by triggering
      CDK7-dependent degradation of RNA polymerase II.

AB  - Triptolide is a bioactive ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that
      exhibits diverse biologic properties, including anticancer properties. Among its 
      many putative targets, this compound has been reported to bind to XPB, the
      largest subunit of general transcription factor TFIIH, and to cause degradation
      of the largest subunit Rpb1 of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In this study, we
      clarify multiple important questions concerning the significance and basis for
      triptolide action at this core target. Triptolide decreased Rpb1 levels in cancer
      cells in a manner that was correlated tightly with its cytotoxic activity.
      Compound exposure blocked RNAPII at promoters and decreased chromatin-bound
      RNAPII, both upstream and within all genes that were examined, also leading to
      Ser-5 hyperphosphorylation and increased ubiqutination within the Rbp1
      carboxy-terminal domain. Notably, cotreatment with inhibitors of the proteasome
      or the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK7 inhibitors abolished the ability of
      triptolide to ablate Rpb1. Together, our results show that triptolide triggers a 
      CDK7-mediated degradation of RNAPII that may offer an explanation to many of its 
      therapeutic properties, including its robust and promising anticancer properties.

      activity in mono- and in combination treatment upon oral application.

LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0286 [doi]
AB  - Deregulated activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) results in loss of
      cell-cycle checkpoint function and increased expression of antiapoptotic
      proteins, which has been directly linked to the molecular pathology of cancer.
      BAY 1000394 inhibits the activity of cell-cycle CDKs CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, and 
      of transcriptional CDKs CDK7 and CDK9 with IC(50) values in the range between 5
      and 25 nmol/L. Cell proliferation was inhibited at low nanomolar concentration in
      a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines. In cell-based assays, the inhibition
      of phosphorylation of the CDK substrates retinoblastoma protein, nucleophosmin,
      and RNA polymerase II was shown. Cell-cycle profiles were consistent with
      inhibition of CDK 1, 2, and 4 as shown in cell-cycle block and release
      experiments. The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of BAY 1000394
      facilitate rapid absorption and moderate oral bioavailability. The compound
      potently inhibits growth of various human tumor xenografts on athymic mice
      including models of chemotherapy resistance upon oral dosing. Furthermore, BAY
      1000394 shows more than additive efficacy when combined with cisplatin and
      etoposide. These results suggest that BAY 1000394 is a potent pan-CDK inhibitor
      and a novel oral cytotoxic agent currently in phase I clinical trials.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinases 7 and 9 specifically regulate neutrophil transcription
      and their inhibition drives apoptosis to promote resolution of inflammation.

AB  - Terminally differentiated neutrophils are short-lived but the key effector cells 
      of the innate immune response, and have a prominent role in the pathogenesis and 
      propagation of many inflammatory diseases. Delayed apoptosis, which is
      responsible for their extended longevity, is critically dependent on a balance of
      intracellular survival versus pro-apoptotic proteins. Here, we elucidate the
      mechanism by which the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor drugs such as
      R-roscovitine and DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) mediate 
      neutrophil apoptosis. We demonstrate (by a combination of microarray, confocal
      microscopy, apoptosis assays and western blotting) that the phosphorylation of
      RNA polymerase II by CDKs 7 and 9 is inhibited by R-roscovitine and that specific
      effects on neutrophil transcriptional capacity are responsible for neutrophil
      apoptosis. Finally, we show that specific CDK7 and 9 inhibition with DRB drives
      resolution of neutrophil-dominant inflammation. Thus, we highlight a novel
      mechanism that controls both primary human neutrophil transcription and apoptosis
      that could be targeted by selective CDK inhibitor drugs to resolve established
      inflammation.

TI  - Ligand binding promotes CDK-dependent phosphorylation of ER-alpha on hinge serine
      294 but inhibits ligand-independent phosphorylation of serine 305.
PG  - 1120-32
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0099 [doi]
AB  - Phosphorylation of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) is critical for its
      transcription factor activity and may determine its predictive and therapeutic
      value as a biomarker for ERalpha-positive breast cancers. Recent attention has
      turned to the poorly understood ERalpha hinge domain, as phosphorylation at
      serine 305 (Ser305) associates with poor clinical outcome and endocrine
      resistance. We show that phosphorylation of a neighboring hinge domain site,
      Ser294, analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry of ERalpha
      immunoprecipitates from human breast cancer cells is robustly phosphorylated
      exclusively by ligand (estradiol and tamoxifen) activation of ERalpha and not by 
      growth factor stimulation (EGF, insulin, heregulin-beta). In a reciprocal
      fashion, Ser305 phosphorylation is induced by growth factors but not ligand
      activation of ERalpha. Phosphorylation at Ser294 and Ser305 is suppressed upon
      co-stimulation by EGF and ligand, respectively, unlike the N-terminal (AF-1)
      domain Ser118 and Ser167 sites of ERalpha where phosphorylation is enhanced by
      ligand and growth factor co-stimulation. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases
      (CDK) by roscovitine or SNS-032 suppresses ligand-activated Ser294
      phosphorylation without affecting Ser118 or Ser104/Ser106 phosphorylation.
      Likewise, cell-free studies using recombinant ERalpha and specific cyclin-CDK
      complexes suggest that Ser294 phosphorylation is primarily induced by the
      transcription-regulating and cell-cycle-independent kinase CDK7. Thus,
      CDK-dependent phosphorylation at Ser294 differentiates ligand-dependent from
      ligand-independent activation of Ser305 phosphorylation, showing that hinge
      domain phosphorylation patterns uniquely inform on the various ERalpha activation
      mechanisms thought to underlie the biologic and clinical diversity of
      hormone-dependent breast cancers.

TI  - Separate domains of fission yeast Cdk9 (P-TEFb) are required for capping enzyme
      recruitment and primed (Ser7-phosphorylated) Rpb1 carboxyl-terminal domain
      substrate recognition.
PG  - 2372-83
LID - 10.1128/MCB.06657-11 [doi]
AB  - In fission yeast, discrete steps in mRNA maturation and synthesis depend on a
      complex containing the 5'-cap methyltransferase Pcm1 and Cdk9, which
      phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) and 
      the processivity factor Spt5 to promote transcript elongation. Here we show that 
      a Cdk9 carboxyl-terminal extension, distinct from the catalytic domain, mediates 
      binding to both Pcm1 and the Pol II CTD. Removal of this segment diminishes
      Cdk9/Pcm1 chromatin recruitment and Spt5 phosphorylation in vivo and leads to
      slow growth and hypersensitivity to cold temperature, nutrient limitation, and
      the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA). These phenotypes, and
      the Spt5 phosphorylation defect, are suppressed by Pcm1 overproduction,
      suggesting that normal transcript elongation and gene expression depend on
      physical linkage between Cdk9 and Pcm1. The extension is dispensable, however,
      for recognition of CTD substrates "primed" by Mcs6 (Cdk7). On defined peptide
      substrates in vitro, Cdk9 prefers CTD repeats phosphorylated at Ser7 over
      unmodified repeats. In vivo, Ser7 phosphorylation depends on Mcs6 activity,
      suggesting a conserved mechanism, independent of chromatin recruitment, to order 
      transcriptional CDK functions. Therefore, fission yeast Cdk9 comprises a
      catalytic domain sufficient for primed substrate recognition and a multivalent
      recruitment module that couples transcription with capping.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)7, the catalytic subunit of the Cdk-activating
      kinase (CAK) complex has been implicated in the control of cell cycle progression
      and of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II)-mediated transcription. Genetic
      inactivation of the Cdk7 locus revealed that whereas Cdk7 is completely
      dispensable for global transcription, is essential for the cell cycle via
      phosphorylation of Cdk1 and Cdk2. In vivo, Cdk7 is also indispensable for cell
      proliferation except during the initial stages of embryonic development.
      Interestingly, widespread elimination of Cdk7 in adult tissues with low
      proliferative indexes had no phenotypic consequences. However, ablation of
      conditional Cdk7 alleles in tissues with elevated cellular turnover led to the
      efficient repopulation of these tissues with Cdk7-expressing cells most likely
      derived from adult stem cells that may have escaped the inactivation of their
      targeted Cdk7 alleles. This process, a physiological attempt to maintain tissue
      homeostasis, led to the attrition of adult stem cell pools and to the appearance 
      of age-related phenotypes, including telomere shortening and early death.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7/9 inhibitor SNS-032 abrogates FIP1-like-1
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and bcr-abl oncogene addiction in
      malignant hematologic cells.
PG  - 1966-78
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1971 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The "gate-keeper" mutations T674I platelet-derived growth factor
      receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) in hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and T315I Bcr-Abl
      in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are resistant to imatinib and the
      second-generation small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, to
      combat acquired resistance to imatinib, an alternative approach is to decrease
      the expression of the addicted gene to efficiently kill resistant malignant
      hematologic cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the strategy of
      shutting down the transcription and expression of FIP1-like-1 (FIP1L1)-PDGFRalpha
      and Bcr-Abl with SNS-032, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and
      CDK9 in phase I clinical trials. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of SNS-032 on
      PDGFRalpha and Bcr-Abl signaling pathways, apoptosis, and cell cycling were
      analyzed in TKI-resistant cells of HES and CML. The in vivo antitumor activity of
      SNS-032 was assessed with xenografted BaF3-T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and KBM5-T315I
      Bcr-Abl cells in nude mouse models. RESULTS: SNS-032 inhibited the
      phosphorylation on Ser5 and Ser2 of RNA polymerase II. SNS-032 decreased both the
      mRNA and protein levels of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and Bcr-Abl and inhibited the
      proliferation of malignant cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha or Bcr-Abl. It also
      decreased the phosphorylation of downstream molecules. It induced apoptosis by
      triggering both the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway.
      CONCLUSIONS: This CDK7/9 inhibitor potently inhibits FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-positive
      HES cells and Bcr-Abl-positive CML cells regardless of their sensitivity to
      imatinib. SNS-032 may have potential in treating hematologic malignancy by
      abrogating oncogene addiction.

TI  - Resveratrol chemosensitizes breast cancer cells to melphalan by cell cycle
      arrest.
PG  - 2586-96
LID - 10.1002/jcb.24134 [doi]
AB  - Melphalan (MEL) is a chemotherapeutic agent used in breast cancer therapy;
      however, MEL's side effects limit its clinical applications. In the last 20
      years, resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol found in grape skins, has been proposed to
      reduce the risk of cancer development. The aim of this study was to investigate
      whether RSV would be able to enhance the antitumor effects of MEL in MCF-7 and
      MDA-MB-231 cells. RSV potentiated the cytotoxic effects of MEL in human breast
      cancer cells. This finding was related to the ability of RSV to sensitize MCF-7
      cells to MEL-induced apoptosis. The sensitization by RSV involved the enhancement
      of p53 levels, the decrease of procaspase 8 and the activation of caspases 7 and 
      9. Another proposed mechanism for the chemosensitization effect of MCF-7 cells to
      MEL by RSV was the cell cycle arrest in the S phase. The treatment with RSV or
      MEL increased the levels of p-Chk2. The increase became pronounced in the
      combined treatments of the compounds. The expression of cyclin A was decreased by
      treatment with RSV and by the combination of RSV with MEL. While the levels of
      cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) remained unchanged by treatments, its active
      form (Thr(160) -phosphorylated CDK2) was decreased by treatment with RSV and by
      the combination of RSV with MEL. The activity of CDK7, kinase that phosphorylates
      CDK2 at Thr(160), was inhibited by RSV and by the combination of RSV with MEL.
      These results indicate that RSV could be used as an adjuvant agent during breast 
      cancer therapy with MEL.

TI  - Flavopiridol induces phosphorylation of AKT in a human glioblastoma cell line, in
      contrast to siRNA-mediated silencing of Cdk9: Implications for drug design and
      development.
PG  - 1202-16
LID - 10.4161/cc.11.6.19663 [doi]
AB  - Cdk9 and Cdk7 are cdc2-like serine/threonine kinases that stabilize RNA
      transcript elongation through RNA polII carboxyl terminal domain (CTD)
      phosphorylation and are considered suitable targets for cancer therapy. The
      effects of flavopiridol and of siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdk9 and/or Cdk7 were
      analyzed in human glioblastoma and human prostate cancer cell lines. One finding 
      revealed that Cdk9 and Cdk7 could substitute each other in RNA polII CTD
      phosphorylation in contrast to the in vitro system. Thus, a simultaneous
      inhibition of Cdk9 and Cdk7 might be required both for targeting malignant cells 
      and developing a platform for microarray analysis. However, these two pathways
      are not redundant, as indicated by differential effects observed in cell cycle
      regulation following siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdk9 and/or Cdk7 in human PC3
      prostate cancer cell line. Specifically, siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdk9 caused
      a shift from G 0/G 1 to G 2/M phase in human PC3 prostate cancer cell line.
      Another finding showed that flavopiridol treatment induced a substantial
      AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation in human glioblastoma T98G cell line in contrast to
      siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdk9 and Cdk9 combined with Cdk7, whereas
      siRNA-mediated silencing of Cdk7 caused a minor increase in AKT-Ser473
      phosphorylation. AKT-Ser473 is a hallmark of AKT pathway activation and may
      protect cells from apoptosis. This finding also shows that Cdk9 and Cdk7 pathways
      are not redundant and may have important implications in drug development and for
      studying the mechanism of chemoresistance in malignant cells.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 activity regulates neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis.
PG  - e30128
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0030128 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte and play a central role in the immune
      defense against rapidly dividing bacteria. However, they are also the shortest
      lived cell in the blood with a lifespan in the circulation of 5.4 days. The
      mechanisms underlying their short lifespan and spontaneous entry into apoptosis
      are poorly understood. Recently, the broad range cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
      inhibitor R-roscovitine was shown to increase neutrophil apoptosis, implicating
      CDKs in the regulation of neutrophil lifespan. To determine which CDKs were
      involved in regulating neutrophil lifespan we first examined CDK expression in
      human neutrophils and found that only three CDKs: CDK5, CDK7 and CDK9 were
      expressed in these cells. The use of CDK inhibitors with differing selectivity
      towards the various CDKs suggested that CDK9 activity regulates neutrophil
      lifespan. Furthermore CDK9 activity and the expression of its activating partner 
      cyclin T1 both declined as neutrophils aged and entered apoptosis spontaneously. 
      CDK9 is a component of the P-TEFb complex involved in transcriptional regulation 
      and its inhibition will preferentially affect proteins with short half-lives.
      Treatment of neutrophils with flavopiridol, a potent CDK9 inhibitor, increased
      apoptosis and caused a rapid decline in the level of the anti-apoptotic protein
      Mcl-1, whilst Bcl2A was unaffected. We propose that CDK9 activity is a key
      regulator of neutrophil lifespan, preventing apoptosis by maintaining levels of
      short lived anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1. Furthermore, as inappropriate 
      inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis contributes to chronic inflammatory diseases
      such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, CDK9 represents a novel therapeutic target in such 
      diseases.

TI  - Genetic variation in nucleotide excision repair pathway genes, pesticide exposure
      and prostate cancer risk.
PG  - 331-7
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgr258 [doi]
AB  - Previous research demonstrates increased prostate cancer risk for pesticide
      applicators and pesticide manufacturing workers. Although underlying mechanisms
      are unknown, human biomonitoring studies indicate increased genetic damage (e.g. 
      chromosomal aberrations) with pesticide exposure. Given that the nucleotide
      excision repair (NER) pathway repairs a broad range of DNA damage, we evaluated
      interactions between pesticide exposure and 324 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) tagging 27 NER genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1444 male
      controls in a nested case-control study of white Agricultural Health Study
      pesticide applicators. We determined interaction P values using likelihood ratio 
      tests from logistic regression models and three-level pesticide variables
      (none/low/high) based on lifetime days of use weighted to an intensity score. We 
      adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Of
      the 17 interactions that met FDR <0.2, 3 displayed a monotonic increase in
      prostate cancer risk with increasing exposure in one genotype group and no
      significant association in the other group. Men carrying the variant A allele at 
      ERCC1 rs2298881 exhibited increased prostate cancer risk with high versus no
      fonofos use [odds ratio (OR) 2.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-5.39;
      P(interact) = 3.6 x 10(-4); FDR-adjusted P = 0.11]. Men carrying the homozygous
      wild-type TT genotype at two correlated CDK7 SNPs, rs11744596 and rs2932778 (r(2)
      = 1.0), exhibited increased risk with high versus no carbofuran use (OR 2.01; 95%
      CI 1.31-3.10 for rs11744596; P(interact) = 7.2 x 10(-4); FDR-adjusted P = 0.09). 
      In contrast, we did not observe associations among men with other genotypes at
      these loci. While requiring replication, our findings suggest a role for NER
      genetic variation in pesticide-associated prostate cancer risk.

TI  - Regulation of Cdk7 activity through a phosphatidylinositol

AB  - The objective of this research was to study the potential function of protein
      kinase C (PKC)-iota in cell cycle progression and proliferation in glioblastoma. 
      PKC-iota is highly overexpressed in human glioma and benign and malignant
      meningioma; however, little is understood about its role in regulating cell
      proliferation of glioblastoma. Several upstream molecular aberrations and/or loss
      of PTEN have been implicated to constitutively activate the phosphatidylinositol 
      (PI) (3)-kinase pathway. PKC-iota is a targeted mediator in the PI (3)-kinase
      signal transduction repertoire. Results showed that PKC-iota was highly activated
      and overexpressed in glioma cells. PKC-iota directly associated and
      phosphorylated Cdk7 at T170 in a cell cycle-dependent manner, phosphorylating its
      downstream target, cdk2 at T160. Cdk2 has a major role in inducing G(1)-S phase
      progression of cells. Purified PKC-iota phosphorylated both endogenous and
      exogenous Cdk7. PKC-iota downregulation reduced Cdk7 and cdk2 phosphorylation
      following PI (3)-kinase inhibition, phosphotidylinositol-dependent kinase 1
      knockdown as well as PKC-iota silencing (by siRNA treatment). It also diminished 
      cdk2 activity. PKC-iota knockdown inhibited overall proliferation rates and
      induced apoptosis in glioma cells. These findings suggest that glioma cells may
      be proliferating through a novel PI (3)-kinase-/PKC-iota/Cdk7/cdk2-mediated
      pathway.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The progression of the mammalian cell cycle is driven by the
      transient activation of complexes consisting of cyclins and cyclin-dependent
      kinases (CDKs). Loss of control over the cell cycle results in accelerated cell
      division and malignant transformation and can be caused by the upregulation of
      cyclins, the aberrant activation of CDKs or the inactivation of cellular CDK
      inhibitors. For these reasons, cell cycle regulators are regarded as very
      promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of human malignancies. AREAS
      COVERED: This review covers the structures and anti-breast cancer activity of
      selected pharmacological pan-specific CDK inhibitors. Multi-targeted CDK
      inhibitors affect CDKs involved in the regulation of both cell cycle progression 
      and transcriptional control. The inhibition of CDK7/CDK9 has a serious impact on 
      the activity of RNA polymerase II; when its carboxy-terminal domain is
      unphosphorylated, it is unable to recruit the cofactors required for
      transcriptional elongation, resulting in a global transcriptional block.
      Multi-targeted inhibition of CDKs represses anti-apoptotic proteins and thus
      promotes the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of CDK7 in estrogen
      receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells prevents activating phosphorylation of
      ER-alpha. EXPERT OPINION: These diverse modes of action make multi-targeted CDK
      inhibitors promising drugs for the treatment of breast cancers.

AB  - Cellular responses to DNA-damaging agents involve the activation of various DNA
      damage signaling and transduction pathways. Using quantitative and
      high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, we determined global changes in protein
      level and phosphorylation site profiles following treatment of SILAC (stable
      isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-labeled murine embryonic stem
      cells with the anticancer drug cisplatin. Network and pathway analyses indicated 
      that processes related to the DNA damage response and cytoskeleton organization
      were significantly affected. Although the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and
      ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) consensus sequence (S/T-Q motif) was significantly
      overrepresented among hyperphosphorylated peptides, about half of the
      >2-fold-upregulated phosphorylation sites based on the consensus sequence were
      not direct substrates of ATM and ATR. Eleven protein kinases mainly belonging to 
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family were identified as being
      regulated in their kinase domain activation loop. The biological importance of
      three of these kinases (cyclin-dependent kinase 7 [CDK7], Plk1, and KPCD1) in the
      protection against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity was demonstrated by small
      interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown. Our results indicate that the
      cellular response to cisplatin involves a variety of kinases and phosphatases not
      only acting in the nucleus but also regulating cytoplasmic targets, resulting in 
      extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements. Integration of transcriptomic and
      proteomic data revealed a poor correlation between changes in the relative levels
      of transcripts and their corresponding proteins, but a large overlap in affected 
      pathways at the levels of mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein. This study provides 
      an integrated view of pathways activated by genotoxic stress and deciphers
      kinases that play a pivotal role in regulating cellular processes other than the 
      DNA damage response.

AB  - CDK-activating kinase (CAK) phosphorylates threonine 161 (T161) of CDC2, a
      catalytic subunit of maturation/M-phase promoting factor (MPF), and is essential 
      for MPF activation in mitosis. CAK has been thought to consist of a catalytic
      subunit, a regulatory subunit and an assembly factor: CDK7, CCNH (also known as
      cyclin H), and MNAT1 (also known as MAT1), respectively. Although it is known
      that the meiotic progression of oocytes is regulated by MPF activity, the role of
      CAK in meiosis is still unclear. In the present study, we attempted to confirm
      the involvement of CAK in the meiotic progression of porcine immature oocytes.
      The T161 phosphorylation of CDC2 was found around germinal vesicle breakdown
      (GVBD) and thereafter from 18 to 48 h of culture. The GVBD rate at 18 h was
      increased by the overexpression of CDC2 but not mutated CDC2 (T161 replaced by
      alanine). Transcripts of CDK7, CCNH, and MNAT1 were detectable throughout the
      culture period, and their protein distribution patterns during oocyte maturation 
      were the same as those reported in mitotic somatic cells. Overexpression of CDK7 
      or CCNH accelerated the meiotic events, such as meiotic resumption, T161
      phosphorylation of CDC2, CCNB (also known as Cyclin B) synthesis, and MPF
      activation. On the contrary, knockdown of CDK7 or CCNH caused the inhibition of
      these meiotic events. In contrast, overexpression and antisense RNA injection of 
      MNAT1 had no influence on meiotic resumption, the status of T161 phosphorylation 
      of CDC2, or MPF activity. These results suggest that CDK7 and CCNH activate CDC2 
      by T161 phosphorylation and make up CAK, which is required for normal meiotic
      progression during porcine oocyte maturation.

AB  - Cilia are ubiquitous cell surface projections that mediate various sensory- and
      motility-based processes and are implicated in a growing number of multi-organ
      genetic disorders termed ciliopathies. To identify new components required for
      cilium biogenesis and function, we sought to further define and validate the
      transcriptional targets of DAF-19, the ciliogenic C. elegans RFX transcription
      factor. Transcriptional profiling of daf-19 mutants (which do not form cilia) and
      wild-type animals was performed using embryos staged to when the cell types
      developing cilia in the worm, the ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs), still
      differentiate. Comparisons between the two populations revealed 881
      differentially regulated genes with greater than a 1.5-fold increase or decrease 
      in expression. A subset of these was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Transgenic
      worms expressing transcriptional GFP fusions revealed CSN-specific expression
      patterns for 11 of 14 candidate genes. We show that two uncharacterized candidate
      genes, termed dyf-17 and dyf-18 because their corresponding mutants display
      dye-filling (Dyf) defects, are important for ciliogenesis. DYF-17 localizes at
      the base of cilia and is specifically required for building the distal segment of
      sensory cilia. DYF-18 is an evolutionarily conserved CDK7/CCRK/LF2p-related
      serine/threonine kinase that is necessary for the proper function of
      intraflagellar transport, a process critical for cilium biogenesis. Together, our
      microarray study identifies targets of the evolutionarily conserved RFX
      transcription factor, DAF-19, providing a rich dataset from which to uncover-in
      addition to DYF-17 and DYF-18-cellular components important for cilium formation 
      and function.

AB  - Cyclin H regulates cell cycle transitions; it always forms trimeric
      cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) complex with CDK7 
      and MAT1 that phosphorylates a threonine residue in the CDK2 T loop region.
      However, neither the expression nor function of cyclin H in the central nervous
      system (CNS) injury is still clear. Therefore, we studied cyclin H in a rat
      spinal cord contusion model. Injury markedly increased cyclin H protein
      expression throughout the thoracic spinal cord but did not increase CDK7.
      However, double immunofluorescent staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen
      (PCNA) and cell markers revealed increases of cyclin H and CDK2 in proliferating 
      microglia and astrocytes, and the co-immunoprecipitation studies shown that the
      associations of cyclin H with CDK2 were enhanced evidently after injury. Our data
      suggest that cyclin H may play a proliferative role in spinal cord injury (SCI).

AB  - The TFIIH multiprotein complex is organized into a 7-subunit core associated with
      a 3-subunit CDK-activating kinase module (CAK). Three enzymatic subunits are
      present in TFIIH, two ATP-dependent DNA helicases: XPB and XPD, and the kinase
      Cdk7. Mutations in three of the subunits, XPB, XPD and TTDA, lead to three
      distinct genetic disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS)
      and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) predisposing patients not only to cancer and ageing
      but also to developmental and neurological defects. These heterogeneous
      phenotypes originate from the dual role of TFIIH in transcription and DNA repair.
      For twenty years, many molecular studies have been conducted with the aim to
      unveil the role of TFIIH in DNA repair and transcription as well as the origin of
      the phenotypes of patients. This review intends to give a non-exhaustive survey
      of the most prominent discoveries on the molecular functioning of TFIIH.

TI  - XPB and XPD helicases in TFIIH orchestrate DNA duplex opening and damage
      verification to coordinate repair with transcription and cell cycle via CAK
      kinase.
PG  - 697-713
LID - 10.1016/j.dnarep.2011.04.028 [doi]
AB  - Helicases must unwind DNA at the right place and time to maintain genomic
      integrity or gene expression. Biologically critical XPB and XPD helicases are key
      members of the human TFIIH complex; they anchor CAK kinase (cyclinH, MAT1, CDK7) 
      to TFIIH and open DNA for transcription and for repair of duplex distorting
      damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER is initiated by arrested RNA
      polymerase or damage recognition by XPC-RAD23B with or without DDB1/DDB2. XP
      helicases, named for their role in the extreme sun-mediated skin cancer
      predisposition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), are then recruited to asymmetrically
      unwind dsDNA flanking the damage. XPB and XPD genetic defects can also cause
      premature aging with profound neurological defects without increased cancers:
      Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). XP helicase patient
      phenotypes cannot be predicted from the mutation position along the linear gene
      sequence and adjacent mutations can cause different diseases. Here we consider
      the structural biology of DNA damage recognition by XPC-RAD23B, DDB1/DDB2,
      RNAPII, and ATL, and of helix unwinding by the XPB and XPD helicases plus the
      bacterial repair helicases UvrB and UvrD in complex with DNA. We then propose
      unified models for TFIIH assembly and roles in NER. Collective crystal structures
      with NMR and electron microscopy results reveal functional motifs, domains, and
      architectural elements that contribute to biological activities: damaged DNA
      binding, translocation, unwinding, and ATP driven changes plus TFIIH assembly and
      signaling. Coupled with mapping of patient mutations, these combined structural
      analyses provide a framework for integrating and unifying the rich biochemical
      and cellular information that has accumulated over forty years of study. This
      integration resolves puzzles regarding XP helicase functions and suggests that XP
      helicase positions and activities within TFIIH detect and verify damage, select
      the damaged strand for incision, and coordinate repair with transcription and
      cell cycle through CAK signaling.

TI  - MicroRNA-27a regulates basal transcription by targeting the p44 subunit of
      general transcription factor IIH.
PG  - 8686-91
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1014018108 [doi]
AB  - General transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a complex RNA polymerase II basal
      transcription factor comprising 10 different polypeptides that display activities
      involved in transcription and DNA repair processes. Although biochemical studies 
      have uncovered TFIIH importance, little is known about how the mRNAs that code
      for TFIIH subunits are regulated. Here it is shown that mRNAs encoding seven of
      the TFIIH subunits (p34, p44, p52, p62, XPB, CDK7, and p8) are regulated at the
      posttranscriptional level in a Dicer-dependent manner. Indeed, abolition of the
      miRNA pathway induces abnormal accumulation, stabilization, and translational
      activation of these seven mRNAs. Herein, miR-27a was identified as a key
      regulator of p44 mRNA. Moreover, miR-27a was shown to destabilize the p44 subunit
      of the TFIIH complex during the G2-M phase, thereby modulating the
      transcriptional shutdown observed during this transition. This work is unique in 
      providing a demonstration of global transcriptional regulation through the action
      of a single miRNA.

      compounds.
PG  - 660-70
LID - 10.1007/s10495-011-0603-3 [doi]
AB  - Chemical inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), like roscovitine, are
      promising drugs in the context of new cancer therapies. Roscovitine and related
      compounds, like seliciclib and olomoucine, are effective inducers of apoptosis in
      many proliferating cells in culture. These compounds are known to activate the
      intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In order to better characterize 
      this intrinsic pathway, a transcriptional analysis was performed using the
      reverse transcriptase-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification procedure 
      (RT-MLPA). In five cell lines, we detected an early and marked reduction of most 
      transcripts, which is consistent with the disruption of transcription that
      results from the inhibition of CDK7 and CDK9. However, the mRNA of
      p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) gene escaped from this
      transcription inhibition in neuroblastoma cells with a functional p53 protein.
      The increase of PUMA mRNA was not found in roscovitine-treated cell lines
      defective in p53, which underwent apoptosis like their p53 proficient
      counterparts. In addition, in SH-SY5Y cells, sublethal and lethal concentrations 
      of roscovitine produced equivalent increases of PUMA mRNA and protein. In
      conclusion, the increased expression of PUMA was not associated with apoptosis
      induction. On the contrary, mRNA and protein depletion of MCL-1 gene correlated
      the best with cell demise. Moreover, NOXA protein suffered a far minor decrease
      than MCL-1. Because of the selective neutralization of NOXA by MCL-1, we
      hypothesize that the disruption of this balance is a critical event in apoptosis 
      induction by roscovitine and related compounds.

TI  - Anti-angiogenic effects of purine inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases.
PG  - 281-91
LID - 10.1007/s10456-011-9212-6 [doi]
AB  - Small molecular inhibitors of Cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) are currently being
      developed as anticancer therapeutics due to their antiproliferative properties.
      The purine Cdk specific inhibitor (R)-roscovitine (seliciclib, CYC202) represents
      one of the most promising of these compounds. It is currently evaluated in
      clinical trials concerning cancer therapy. Recently, we have shown that
      roscovitine exerts potent antiangiogenic effects and elucidated Cdk5 as a new
      player in angiogenesis. These findings introduce Cdk5 as novel target for
      antiangiogenic therapy, and Cdk5 inhibitors as an attractive therapeutic
      approach. Here, we present the antiangiogenic profile of 15 derivatives of
      roscovitine in vitro and in vivo and provide structure activity relationships of 
      the roscovitine analogs. The (S)-isomer LGR561 and the respective (R)- and
      (S)-isomers LGR848 and LGR849 strongly inhibited proliferation and cell cycle
      progression, induced cell death, and reduced migration of endothelial cells in
      vitro. In comparison to roscovitine, these compounds showed an increased potency 
      to inhibit Cdk2, Cdk5, Cdk7, and Cdk9. By analyzing the effects of LGR561,
      LGR848, and LGR849 on endothelial cell tube formation, mouse aortic ring
      sprouting, angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane, and neovessel
      formation in the mouse cornea, we elucidate the two (S)-isomers LGR561 and LGR849
      as highly potent inhibitors of angiogenesis. This study provides first
      information on how to modify roscovitine to develop Cdk inhibitors with increased
      antiangiogenic activity and suggests the application of existing and the
      development of new Cdk inhibitors to inhibit both, cancer cell proliferation and 
      angiogenesis.

TI  - Ibulocydine is a novel prodrug Cdk inhibitor that effectively induces apoptosis
      in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
PG  - 19662-71
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.209551 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently associated with abnormalities in
      cell cycle regulation, leading to increased activity of cyclin-dependent kinases 
      (Cdks) due to the loss, or low expression of, Cdk inhibitors. In this study, we
      showed that ibulocydine (an isobutyrate prodrug of the specific Cdk inhibitor,
      BMK-Y101) is a candidate anti-cancer drug for HCC. Ibulocydine has high activity 
      against Cdk7/cyclin H/Mat1 and Cdk9/cyclin T. Ibulocydine inhibited the growth of
      HCC cells more effectively than other Cdk inhibitors, including olomoucine and
      roscovitine, whereas ibulocydine as well as the other Cdk inhibitors and BMK-Y101
      minimally influenced the growth of normal hepatocyte cells. Ibulocydine induced
      apoptosis in HCC cells, most likely by inhibiting Cdk7 and Cdk9. In vitro
      treatment of HCC cells with ibulocydine rapidly blocked phosphorylation of the
      carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, a
      process mediated by Cdk7/9. Anti-apoptotic gene products such as Mcl-1, survivin,
      and X-linked IAP (XIAP) are crucial for the survival of many cell types,
      including HCC. Following the inhibition of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation,
      ibulocydine caused rapid down-regulation of Mcl-1, survivin, and XIAP, thus
      inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, ibulocydine effectively induced apoptosis in HCC
      xenografts with no toxic side effects. These results suggest that ibulocydine is 
      a strong candidate anti-cancer drug for the treatment of HCC.

TI  - Myricetin induces G2/M phase arrest in HepG2 cells by inhibiting the activity of 
      the cyclin B/Cdc2 complex.
PG  - 273-7
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2011.417 [doi]
AB  - Myricetin, a naturally occurring flavonol, has been shown to inhibit the
      proliferation of human hepatoma HepG2 cells and to induce G2/M phase arrest.
      However, the underlying mechanisms of Myricetin activity have yet to be revealed.
      The aim of the present study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms of cell
      cycle arrest induced by myricetin in HepG2 cells. The MTT assay confirmed that
      exposure of HepG2 cells to myricetin triggered G2/M phase arrest. Western blot
      analysis showed that myricetin increased the protein levels of the p53/p21
      cascade, and markedly decreased Cdc2 and cyclin B1 protein levels in HepG2 cells.
      Additionally, myricetin treatment resulted in the up-regulation of Thr14/Tyr15
      phosphorylated (inactive) Cdc2 and p27, and the down-regulation of CDK7 kinase
      protein, as well as CDK7-mediated Thr161 phosphorylated (active) Cdc2. These data
      indicate that a decrease in cyclin B/Cdc2 complex activity mediated G2/M phase
      arrest induced by myricetin in HepG2 cells. This novel finding provides insight
      into the potential applications of myricetin in the treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

TI  - Roscovitine, a selective CDK inhibitor, reduces the basal and estrogen-induced
      phosphorylation of ER-alpha in human ER-positive breast cancer cells.
PG  - 761-72
LID - 10.1002/jcb.23004 [doi]
AB  - Roscovitine (ROSC), a selective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, arrests 
      human estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells in
      the G(2) phase of the cell cycle and concomitantly induces apoptosis via a
      p53-dependent pathway. The effect of ROSC is markedly diminished in MCF-7 cells
      maintained in the presence of estrogen-mimicking compounds. Therefore, we decided
      to examine whether ROSC has any effect on the functional status of the ER-alpha
      transcription factor. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to ROSC abolished the activating
      phosphorylation of CDK2 and CDK7 in a concentration and time-dependent manner.
      This inhibition of site-specific modification of CDK7 at Ser164/170 prevented
      phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and reduced basal phosphorylation of
      ER-alpha at Ser118 in non-stimulated MCF-7 cells (resulting in its
      down-regulation). In MCF-7 cells, estrogen induced strong phosphorylation of
      ER-alpha at Ser118 but not at Ser104/Ser106. ROSC prevented this
      estrogen-promoted activating modification of ER-alpha. Furthermore, we sought to 
      determine whether the activity of ROSC could be enhanced by combining it with an 
      anti-estrogen. Tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM),
      affected breast cancer cell lines irrespective of their ER status. In combination
      with ROSC, however, it had a different impact, enhancing G(1) or G(2) arrest. Our
      results indicate that ROSC prevents the activating phosphorylation of ER-alpha
      and that its mode of action is strongly dependent on the cellular context.
      Furthermore, our data show that ROSC can be combined with anti-estrogen therapy. 
      The inhibitory effect of TAM on ER-negative cancer cells indicates that SERMs
      crosstalk with other steroid hormone receptors.

AB  - Mouse B2 RNA represses RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription during the
      cellular heat shock response. B2 RNA binds Pol II, enters complexes at promoters,
      and keeps the polymerase from engaging the DNA. Here we show that phosphorylation
      of Ser5 residues in the Pol II carboxy terminal domain (CTD) decreases after heat
      shock at the promoter of the repressed actin gene in mouse cells, despite the
      continued presence of Cdk7 and cyclin H. Biochemical assays revealed that B2 RNA,
      when present with Pol II in promoter-bound complexes, specifically represses CTD 
      phosphorylation by TFIIH.

AB  - Protein Kinase C-iota (PKC-iota), an atypical protein kinase C isoform manifests 
      its potential as an oncogene by targeting various aspects of cancer cells such as
      growth, invasion and survival. PKC-iota confers resistance to drug-induced
      apoptosis in cancer cells. The acquisition of drug resistance is a major obstacle
      to good prognosis in neuroblastoma. The focus of this research was to identify
      the efficacy of [4-(5-amino-4-carbamoylimidazol-1-yl)-2,3-dihydroxycyclopentyl]
      methyl dihydrogen phosphate (ICA-1) as a novel PKC-iota inhibitor in
      neuroblastoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. ICA-1 specifically inhibits the
      activity of PKC-iota but not that of PKC-zeta (PKC-zeta), the closely related
      atypical PKC family member. The IC(50) for the kinase activity assay was
      approximately 0.1muM which is 1000 times less than that of aurothiomalate, a
      known PKC-iota inhibitor. Cyclin dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) phosphorylates cyclin 
      dependent kinases (cdks) and promotes cell proliferation. Our data shows that
      PKC-iota is an in vitro Cdk7 kinase and the phosphorylation of Cdk7 by PKC-iota
      was potently inhibited by ICA-1. Furthermore, our data shows that neuroblastoma
      cells proliferate via a PKC-iota/Cdk7/cdk2 cell signaling pathway and ICA-1
      mediates its antiproliferative effects by inhibiting this pathway. ICA-1 (0.1muM)
      inhibited the in vitro proliferation of BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells by 58%
      (P=0.01). Additionally, ICA-1 also induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.
      Interestingly, ICA-1 did not affect the proliferation of normal neuronal cells
      suggesting its potential as chemotherapeutic with low toxicity. Hence, our
      results emphasize the potential of ICA-1 as a novel PKC-iota inhibitor and
      chemotherapeutic agent for neuroblastoma.

TI  - Interference with ER-alpha enhances the therapeutic efficacy of the selective CDK
      inhibitor roscovitine towards ER-positive breast cancer cells.
PG  - 1103-17
LID - 10.1002/jcb.23024 [doi]
AB  - In recent years many risk factors for the development of breast cancer that are
      linked to estrogens have been identified, and roscovitine (ROSC), a selective
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, has been shown to be an efficient
      inhibitor of the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. Therefore, we have
      examined the possibility that interference with estrogen signaling pathways,
      using tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), could
      modulate the efficacy of treatment with ROSC. In conjunction with TAM, ROSC
      exhibited enhanced anti-proliferative activity and CDK inhibition, particularly
      in estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells. The interaction between both drugs was
      synergistic. However, in ER-alpha-negative cells the interaction was
      antagonistic. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to ROSC abolished the activating
      phosphorylation of CDK2 and CDK7 at Ser(164/170). This in turn prevented the
      phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain of RNA Polymerase II and
      ER-alpha at Ser(118), resulting in the down-regulation of the latter.
      Concomitantly, wt p53 was strongly activated by phosphorylation at Ser(46). Our
      results demonstrate that ROSC negatively affects the functional status of
      ER-alpha, making it potentially useful in the treatment of estrogen-dependent
      breast cancer cells.

TI  - Evolution of nuclear retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) phosphorylation
      sites. Serine gain provides fine-tuned regulation.
PG  - 2125-37
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msr035 [doi]
AB  - The human nuclear retinoic acid (RA) receptor alpha (hRARalpha) is a
      ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator, which is controlled by a
      phosphorylation cascade. The cascade starts with the RA-induced phosphorylation
      of a serine residue located in the ligand-binding domain, S(LBD), allowing the
      recruitment of the cdk7/cyclin H/MAT1 subcomplex of TFIIH through the docking of 
      cyclin H. It ends by the subsequent phosphorylation by cdk7 of an other serine
      located in the N-terminal domain, S(NTD). Here, we show that this cascade relies 
      on an increase in the flexibility of the domain involved in cyclin H binding,
      subsequently to the phosphorylation of S(LBD). Owing to the functional importance
      of RARalpha in several vertebrate species, we investigated whether the
      phosphorylation cascade was conserved in zebrafish (Danio rerio), which expresses
      two RARalpha genes: RARalpha-A and RARalpha-B. We found that in zebrafish
      RARalphas, S(LBD) is absent, whereas S(NTD) is conserved and phosphorylated.
      Therefore, we analyzed the pattern of conservation of the phosphorylation sites
      and traced back their evolution. We found that S(LBD) is most often absent
      outside mammalian RARalpha and appears late during vertebrate evolution. In
      contrast, S(NTD) is conserved, indicating that the phosphorylation of this
      functional site has been under ancient high selection constraint. This suggests
      that, during evolution, different regulatory circuits control RARalpha activity.

TI  - The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor SNS-032 has single agent activity in AML
      cells and is highly synergistic with cytarabine.
PG  - 411-9
LID - 10.1038/leu.2010.290 [doi]
AB  - SNS-032 (BMS-387032) is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. In
      this study, we evaluated its effects on primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      samples (n=87). In vitro exposure to SNS-032 for 48 h resulted in a mean LD(50)
      of 139+/-203 nM; Cytarabine (Ara-C) was more than 35 times less potent in the
      same cohort. SNS-032-induced a dose-dependent increase in annexin V staining and 
      caspase-3 activation. At the molecular level, SNS-032 induced a marked
      dephosphorylation of serine 2 and 5 of RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) II and inhibited 
      the expression of CDK2 and CDK9 and dephosphorylated CDK7. Furthermore, the
      combination of SNS-032 and Ara-C showed remarkable synergy that was associated
      with reduced mRNA levels of the antiapoptotic genes XIAP, BCL2 and MCL1. In
      conclusion, SNS-032 is effective as a single agent and in combination with Ara-C 
      in primary AML blasts. Treatment with Ara-C alone significantly induced the
      transcription of the antiapoptotic genes BCL2 and XIAP. In contrast, the
      combination of SNS-032 and Ara-C suppressed the transcription of BCL2, XIAP and
      MCL1. Therefore, the combination of SNS-032 and Ara-C may increase the
      sensitivity of AML cells to the cytotoxic effects of Ara-C by inhibiting the
      transcription of antiapoptotic genes.

TI  - Roscovitine inhibits EBNA1 serine 393 phosphorylation, nuclear localization,
      transcription, and episome maintenance.
PG  - 2859-68
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01628-10 [doi]
AB  - Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection causes human lymphomas and carcinomas. 
      EBV usually persists as an episome in malignant cells. EBV episome persistence,
      replication, and gene expression are dependent on EBNA1 binding to multiple
      cognate sites in oriP. To search for inhibitors of EBNA1- and oriP-dependent
      episome maintenance or transcription, a library of 40,550 small molecules was
      screened for compounds that inhibit EBNA1- and oriP-dependent transcription and
      do not inhibit EBNA1- and oriP-independent transcription. This screening
      identified roscovitine, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 1
      (CDK1), CDK2, CDK5, and CDK7. Based on motif predictions of EBNA1 serine 393 as a
      CDK phosphorylation site and (486)RALL(489) and (580)KDLVM(584) as potential
      cyclin binding domains, we hypothesized that cyclin binding to EBNA1 may enable
      CDK1, -2, -5, or -7 to phosphorylate serine 393. We found that Escherichia
      coli-expressed EBNA1 amino acids 387 to 641 were phosphorylated in vitro by
      CDK1-, -2-, -5-, and -7/cyclin complexes and serine 393 phosphorylation was
      roscovitine inhibited. Further, S393A mutation abrogated phosphorylation. S393A
      mutant EBNA1 was deficient in supporting EBNA1- and oriP-dependent transcription 
      and episome persistence, and roscovitine had little further effect on the
      diminished S393A mutant EBNA1-mediated transcription or episome persistence.
      Immunoprecipitated FLAG-EBNA1 was phosphorylated in vitro, and roscovitine
      inhibited this phosphorylation. Moreover, roscovitine decreased nuclear EBNA1 and
      often increased cytoplasmic EBNA1, whereas S393A mutant EBNA1 was localized
      equally in the nucleus and cytoplasm and was unaffected by roscovitine treatment.
      These data indicate that roscovitine effects are serine 393 specific and that
      serine 393 is important in EBNA1- and oriPCp-dependent transcription and episome 
      persistence.

AB  - In response to hormonal stimuli, a cascade of hierarchical post-translational
      modifications of nuclear receptors are required for the correct expression of
      target genes. Here, we show that the transcription factor TFIIH, via its cdk7
      kinase, phosphorylates the androgen receptor (AR) at position AR/S515.
      Strikingly, this phosphorylation is a key step for an accurate transactivation
      that includes the cyclic recruitment of the transcription machinery, the MDM2 E3 
      ligase, the subsequent ubiquitination of AR at the promoter of target genes and
      its degradation by the proteasome machinery. Impaired phosphorylation disrupts
      the transactivation, as observed in cells either overexpressing the
      non-phosphorylated AR/S515A, isolated from xeroderma pigmentosum patient (bearing
      a mutation in XPD subunit of TFIIH), or in which cdk7 kinase was silenced.
      Indeed, besides affecting the cyclic recruitment of the transcription machinery, 
      the AR phosphorylation defect favourizes to the recruitment of the E3 ligase CHIP
      instead of MDM2, at the PSA promoter, that will further attract the proteasome
      machinery. These observations illustrate how the TFIIH phosphorylation might
      participate to the transactivation by regulating the nuclear receptors turnover.

AB  - The cell cycle governs the proliferation and growth of cells and is strictly
      controlled by some regulators including cyclins, CDKs and CKIs. Germ-line and
      somatic mutations in cell cycle genes were frequently observed in a subset of
      cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we
      hypothesized that potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in cell cycle genes may contribute to the prognosis of NSCLC in China. 54
      potentially functional polymorphisms in key cell cycle genes (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4,
      CDK6, CDK7, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CCNA1, CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNH, p15, p16, p18,
      p19, p21, p27, Cdc25A and Cdc25B) were genotyped by using Illumina SNP genotyping
      platform to evaluate their associations with survival of NSCLC in a clinical
      cohort of 568 patients. We found that p18 rs3176447 variant genotypes were
      significantly associated with the decreased risk of death of NSCLC patients
      (adjusted HR=0.74, 95% CI=0.57-0.97 in an additive model; adjusted HR=0.76, 95%
      CI=0.55-0.97 in a dominant model); however, p21 rs2395655 variant genotypes were 
      significantly associated with the increased risk of death (adjusted HR=1.21, 95% 
      CI=1.02-1.42 in an additive model; adjusted HR=1.38, 95% CI=1.07-1.78 in a
      recessive model). Furthermore, the combined effect of unfavorable genotypes for
      these two SNPs was more prominent in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, late 
      stage and without chemo- or radio-therapy. Although the exact biological function
      remains to be explored, our findings suggest possible association of
      polymorphisms of p18 and p21 with the prognosis of NSCLC in a Chinese population.
      Further large and functional studies are needed to confirm our findings.

      protein kinases 1, 2, and 9, which demonstrates antitumor effects in human tumor 
      xenografts following oral administration.

AB  - Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are central to the appropriate regulation
      of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression. Abnormalities in CDK
      activity and regulation are common features of cancer, making CDK family members 
      attractive targets for the development of anticancer drugs. Here, we report the
      identification of a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derived compound, 4k (BS-194), as a
      selective and potent CDK inhibitor, which inhibits CDK2, CDK1, CDK5, CDK7, and
      CDK9 (IC(5)(0)= 3, 30, 30, 250, and 90 nmol/L, respectively). Cell-based studies 
      showed inhibition of the phosphorylation of CDK substrates, Rb and the RNA
      polymerase II C-terminal domain, down-regulation of cyclins A, E, and D1, and
      cell cycle block in the S and G(2)/M phases. Consistent with these findings, 4k
      demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity in 60 cancer cell lines tested
      (mean GI(5)(0)= 280 nmol/L). Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 4k is orally
      bioavailable, with an elimination half-life of 178 min following oral dosing in
      mice. When administered at a concentration of 25 mg/kg orally, 4k inhibited human
      tumor xenografts and suppressed CDK substrate phosphorylation. These findings
      identify 4k as a novel, potent CDK selective inhibitor with potential for oral
      delivery in cancer patients.

AB  - The main difficulty in the development of ATP antagonist kinase inhibitors is
      target specificity, since the ATP-binding motif is present in many proteins. We
      introduce a strategy that has allowed us to identify compounds from a kinase
      inhibitor library that block the cyclin-dependent kinases responsible for
      regulating transcription, i.e., CDK7 and especially CDK9. The screening cascade
      employs cellular phenotypic assays based on mitotic index and nuclear p53 protein
      accumulation. This permitted us to classify compounds into transcriptional, cell 
      cycle, and mitotic inhibitor groups. We describe the characterization of the
      transcriptional inhibitor class in terms of kinase inhibition profile, cellular
      mode of action, and selectivity for transformed cells. A structural selectivity
      rationale was used to optimize potency and biopharmaceutical properties and led
      to the development of a transcriptional inhibitor,
      3,4-dimethyl-5-[2-(4-piperazin-1-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-3H-thiazol-2-one
      , with anticancer activity in animal models.

      carcinoma HepG2 cells.

AB  - We recently established that NCPMF-60, a newly synthesized flavonoid, is an
      active cytotoxic component. The molecular mechanisms by which NCPMF-60 exerts its
      cytotoxic activity are currently unknown. In this study, we show that NCPMF-60
      induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2
      cells. After treatment of HepG2 cells with NCPMF-60, cell cycle-related proteins,
      such as cyclin B1, cyclin H, CDK7, and p-CDK1 (Thr161), were downregulated,
      whereas p21 and p-CDK1 (Thr14/Tyr15) were upregulated. The activity of
      CDK1/cyclinB complex was also inhibited by NCPMF-60. In addition, we observed
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9.
      The expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was increased in the treated cells, in which
      Bax was also upregulated. We also found that the expression of p53 and its
      phosphorylation at Ser15 accumulated after the treatment of NCPMF-60. Moreover,
      upregulation of p21, p53-upregulated modifier of apoptosis, and Bax, three
      p53-target gene products, and the downregulation of Bcl-2 and MDM2, were observed
      in NCPMF-60-treated cells. However, p53 is not the only regulator in the
      stimulation of NCPMF-60 on p21 transcriptional level and posttranscriptional
      level. These results suggested that NCPMF-60 indeed activated the p53 pathway,
      which may contribute to its induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HepG2
      cells. Collectively, our findings show that cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
      induced by NCPMF-60 was associated with the activation of p53 pathway and the
      inhibition of CDK-activating kinase activity in HepG2 cells.

AB  - The pharmacological induction of apoptosis in neoplastic B cells presents a
      promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL). We profiled a panel of clinical multi-kinase inhibitors for their ability 
      to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells. Whereas inhibitors targeting a large
      number of receptor and intracellular tyrosine kinases including c-KIT, FLT3, BTK 
      and SYK were comparatively inactive, the CDK inhibitors BMS-387032 and
      flavopiridol showed marked efficacy similar to staurosporine. Using the kinobeads
      proteomics method, kinase expression profiles and binding profiles of the
      inhibitors to target protein complexes were quantitatively monitored in CLL
      cells. The targets most potently affected were CDK9, cyclin T1, AFF3/4 and MLLT1,
      which may represent four subunits of a deregulated positive transcriptional
      elongation factor (p-TEFb) complex. Albeit with lower potency, both drugs also
      bound the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH containing CDK7. Staurosporine
      and geldanamycin do not affect these targets and thus seem to exhibit a different
      mechanism of action. The data support a critical role of p-TEFb inhibitors in CLL
      that supports their future clinical development.

TI  - Cell cycle arrest in cultured neuroblastoma cells exposed to a
      bis(thiosemicarbazonato) metal complex.

AB  - Brain tumors such as neuroblastomas and gliomas are often refractory to current
      treatments. Development of metal-based drugs may offer an alternative approach
      due to the ability to deliver radionuclides or cytotoxic metals to the tumor.
      Previous studies have shown that
      diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)-copper(II) (Cu(II)(atsm)) can
      selectively target hypoxic tumors and this feature has been utilized for
      development of imaging and radiotherapy. However, we have recently shown that
      glyoxal-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)-copper(II) (Cu(II)(gtsm)) can target 
      the brain in animal models of neurodegeneration. Unlike Cu(II)(atsm),
      Cu(II)(gtsm) is able to release Cu intracellularly under normoxic conditions.
      Glyoxal-bis(thiosemicarbazones) have reported anticancer effects but little is
      known about the cellular mechanisms involved. Therefore, in this study, we used
      protein microarray analysis to investigate the effect of Cu(II)(gtsm) on
      neuroblastoma cell growth in vitro. Treatment of the human neuroblastoma cell
      line BE(2)-M17, resulted in cell cycle arrest as assessed by fluorescent
      activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Rapidly arrested growth was not
      associated with onset of apoptosis. Instead, protein microarray analysis revealed
      that Cu(II)(gtsm) rapidly and potently reduced cyclin D1 expression, while
      increasing Kip2 expression. Other changes observed were decreased Cdk7 expression
      and activation of CHK2. These changes may be associated with the cell cycle
      arrest. We also observed a potent decrease of total and phosphorylated
      insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) by Cu(II)(gtsm) which is associated 
      with modulation of cyclin D1 expression. Our studies reveal important insights
      into the potential anticancer activity of Cu(II)(gtsm). Further studies are
      needed to examine the therapeutic potential of Cu(II)(gtsm) and other
      bis(thiosemicarbazonato) metal complexes as metallo-drugs for treatment of
      systemic or brain tumors.

      inhibitor binding requirements.
PG  - 1169-82
LID - 10.1021/cb1001262 [doi]
AB  - An alternative strategy for inhibition of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) in 
      antitumor drug discovery is afforded through the substrate recruitment site on
      the cyclin positive regulatory subunit. Critical CDK substrates such as the Rb
      and E2F families must undergo cyclin groove binding before phosphorylation, and
      hence inhibitors of this interaction also block substrate specific kinase
      activity. This approach offers the potential to generate highly selective and
      cell cycle specific CDK inhibitors and to reduce the inhibition of transcription 
      mediated through CDK7 and 9, commonly observed with ATP competitive compounds.
      While highly potent peptide and small molecule inhibitors of CDK2/cyclin A, E
      substrate recruitment have been reported, little information has been generated
      on the determinants of inhibitor binding to the cyclin groove of the CDK4/cyclin 
      D1 complex. CDK4/cyclin D is a validated anticancer drug target and continues to 
      be widely pursued in the development of new therapeutics based on cell cycle
      blockade. We have therefore investigated the structural basis for peptide binding
      to its cyclin groove and have examined the features contributing to potency and
      selectivity of inhibitors. Peptidic inhibitors of CDK4/cyclin D of pRb
      phosphorylation have been synthesized, and their complexes with CDK4/cyclin D1
      crystal structures have been generated. Based on available structural
      information, comparisons of the cyclin grooves of cyclin A2 and D1 are presented 
      and provide insights into the determinants for peptide binding and the basis for 
      differential binding and inhibition. In addition, a complex structure has been
      generated in order to model the interactions of the CDKI, p27(KIP)(1), with
      cyclin D1. This information has been used to shed light onto the endogenous
      inhibition of CDK4 and also to identify unique aspects of cyclin D1 that can be
      exploited in the design of cyclin groove based CDK inhibitors. Peptidic and
      nonpeptidic compounds have been synthesized in order to explore
      structure-activity relationship for binding to the cyclin D1 groove, which to
      date has not been carried out in a systematic fashion. Collectively, the data
      presented provide new insights into how compounds can be developed that function 
      as chemical biology probes to determine the cellular and antitumor effects of CDK
      inhibition. Furthermore, such compounds will serve as templates for
      structure-guided efforts to develop potential therapeutics based on selective
      inhibition of CDK4/cyclin D activity.

TI  - R-Roscovitine (Seliciclib) prevents DNA damage-induced cyclin A1 upregulation and
      hinders non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair.
PG  - 208
LID - 10.1186/1476-4598-9-208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CDK-inhibitors can diminish transcriptional levels of cell
      cycle-related cyclins through the inhibition of E2F family members and CDK7 and
      9. Cyclin A1, an E2F-independent cyclin, is strongly upregulated under genotoxic 
      conditions and functionally was shown to increase NHEJ activity. Cyclin A1
      outcompetes with cyclin A2 for CDK2 binding, possibly redirecting its activity
      towards DNA repair. To see if we could therapeutically block this switch, we
      analyzed the effects of the CDK-inhibitor R-Roscovitine on the expression levels 
      of cyclin A1 under genotoxic stress and observed subsequent DNA damage and repair
      mechanisms. RESULTS: We found that R-Roscovitine alone was unable to alter cyclin
      A1 transcriptional levels, however it was able to reduce protein expression
      through a proteosome-dependent mechanism. When combined with DNA damaging agents,
      R-Roscovitine was able to prevent the DNA damage-induced upregulation of cyclin
      A1 on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. This, moreover resulted
      in a significant decrease in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) paired with an
      increase in DNA DSBs and overall DNA damage over time. Furthermore, microarray
      analysis demonstrated that R-Roscovitine affected DNA repair mechanisms in a more
      global fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal a new mechanism of action for
      R-Roscovitine on DNA repair through the inhibition of the molecular switch
      between cyclin A family members under genotoxic conditions resulting in reduced
      NHEJ capability.

      methylation-dependent deacetylation of ORF nucleosomes.
PG  - 234-46
LID - 10.1016/j.molcel.2010.07.003 [doi]
AB  - Methylation of histone H3 by Set1 and Set2 is required for deacetylation of
      nucleosomes in coding regions by histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs) Set3C and 
      Rpd3C(S), respectively. We report that Set3C and Rpd3C(S) are cotranscriptionally
      recruited in the absence of Set1 and Set2, but in a manner stimulated by Pol II
      CTD kinase Cdk7/Kin28. Consistently, Rpd3C(S) and Set3C interact with
      Ser5-phosphorylated Pol II and histones in extracts, but only the histone
      interactions require H3 methylation. Moreover, reconstituted Rpd3C(S) binds
      specifically to Ser5-phosphorylated CTD peptides in vitro. Hence, whereas
      interaction with methylated H3 residues is required for Rpd3C(S) and Set3C
      deacetylation activities, their cotranscriptional recruitment is stimulated by
      the phosphorylated CTD. We further demonstrate that Rpd3, Hos2, and Hda1 have
      overlapping functions in deacetylating histones and suppressing cotranscriptional
      histone eviction. A strong correlation between increased acetylation and lower
      histone occupancy in HDA mutants implies that histone acetylation is important
      for nucleosome eviction.

TI  - Responses in mantle cell lymphoma cells to SNS-032 depend on the biological
      context of each cell line.
PG  - 6587-97
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3578 [doi]
AB  - SNS-032 is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) 2, 7, and 9 that 
      regulate the cell cycle and transcription. Our studies in indolent primary
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells showed that SNS-032 inhibited transcription,
      diminished the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, and induced apoptosis. The present
      study focuses on evaluating this compound in four proliferating mantle cell
      lymphoma lines (Jeko-1, Granta 519, Mino, and SP-53). Consistent with its action 
      against Cdk9 and Cdk7, SNS-032 inhibited the phosphorylation of RNA pol II in all
      four lines and blocked RNA synthesis. The transcripts and protein levels of
      short-lived proteins decreased, including cyclin D1 and Mcl-1. Cell growth was
      inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner in all lines. Apoptosis was induced
      in JeKo-1, Mino, and SP-53 cells without disrupting cell cycle distribution.
      However, apoptosis was limited in Granta cells; rather, there was a significant
      reduction of clonogenic survival. Small interfering RNA was used to specifically 
      knock down Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 in JeKo-1 and Granta cells. Knocking down Mcl-1
      induced significant apoptosis in Jeko-1 cells but not Granta cells. Reducing
      cyclin D1, rather than Mcl-1, was associated with loss of clonogenic survival in 
      Granta cells. Thus, these results indicated that mantle cell lymphoma cell lines 
      have distinct mechanisms sustaining their survival, and the mechanism of action
      of SNS-032 is dependent on the biological context of an individual line.

AB  - Transcriptional regulation of the Nos2 gene encoding inducible nitric oxide
      synthase (iNOS) requires type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and additional
      signals emanating from pattern recognition receptors. Here we showed sequential
      and cooperative contributions of the transcription factors ISGF3 (a complex
      containing STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 subunits) and NF-kappaB to the transcriptional 
      induction of the Nos2 gene in macrophages infected with the intracellular
      bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. NF-kappaB preceded ISGF3 at the Nos2
      promoter and generated a transcriptional memory effect by depositing basal
      transcription factor TFIIH with the associated CDK7 kinase for serine 5
      phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) carboxyterminal domain (CTD).
      Subsequent to TFIIH deposition by NF-kappaB, ISGF3 attracted the pol II enzyme
      and phosphorylation at CTD S5 occurred. Thus, STATs and NF-kappaB cooperate
      through pol II promoter recruitment and the phosphorylation of its CTD,
      respectively, as a prerequisite for productive elongation of iNOS mRNA.

AB  - Cyclin dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are pursued as drug targets for several
      eukaryotic pathogens. In this study, we identified thiophene and benzene
      sulfonamides as potent inhibitors of Pfmrk, a Plasmodium falciparum CDK with
      sequence homology to human CDK7. Several of the compounds demonstrated inhibitor 
      selectivity for CDK7 over CDK1, CDK2, and CDK6. The compounds are moderate
      antimalarial agents against drug resistant parasites and possess encouraging in
      vitro therapeutic indices as determined against human cell lines. One particular 
      sub-class of compounds, bromohydrosulfonylacetamides, was specific for Pfmrk with
      IC(50) values in the sub-micromolar range. These compounds represent the most
      potent Pfmrk inhibitors reported and provide support for further characterization
      and derivation as potential antimalarial agents.

AB  - The baculovirus expression vector system is recognized as a powerful and
      versatile tool for producing large quantities of recombinant proteins that cannot
      be obtained in Escherichia coli. Here we report (i) the purification of the
      recombinant cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which 
      includes CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1 proteins, and (ii) the functional
      characterization of CAK together with a detailed analysis and mapping of the
      phosphorylation states and sites using mass spectrometry (MS). In vitro kinase
      assay showed that recombinant CAK is able to phosphorylate the cyclin-dependent
      kinase CDK2 implicated in cell cycle progression and the carboxy-terminal domain 
      (CTD) of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II. An original combination of MS
      techniques was used for the determination of the phosphorylation sites of each
      constitutive subunit at both protein and peptide levels. Liquid chromatography
      (LC)-MS analysis of intact proteins demonstrated that none of the CAK subunits
      was fully modified and that the phosphorylation pattern of recombinant CAK is
      extremely heterogeneous. Finally, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
      (MALDI)-MS and nanoLC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques were used for
      the analysis of the major phosphorylation sites of each subunit, showing that all
      correspond to Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylations occurred on Ser164 
      and Thr170 residues of CDK7, Thr315 residue of cyclin H, and Ser279 residue of
      MAT1.

TI  - Dissecting the transcriptional functions of human DNA topoisomerase I by
      selective inhibitors: implications for physiological and therapeutic modulation
      of enzyme activity.
PG  - 240-50
LID - 10.1016/j.bbcan.2010.06.003 [doi]
AB  - Camptothecin is a selective inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I, and has effective
      antitumor activity. Recently, camptothecin has been shown to activate the
      transcription of low-abundance antisense RNAs at the HIF-1alpha gene locus in
      human cancer cells in a Topoisomerase I-dependent manner. The activation of
      antisense transcription is likely due to sustained drug interference with
      transcription regulation mechanisms leading to a more open chromatin conformation
      and de-repression/activation of antisense transcription. Camptothecin readily
      inhibits Topoisomerase I in cells, and the enzyme inhibition activates
      transcriptional Cdk (Cdk9 and/or Cdk7) activity leading to the
      hyperphosphorylation of the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP
      II). This results in an alteration of RNAP II regulation with specific effects at
      transcription levels. Thus, the findings have documented that camptothecin can
      interfere with specific transcription regulatory steps, impairing the balance of 
      cellular antisense and sense transcripts at the HIF-1alpha gene locus. That may
      have a considerable impact on cancer therapy development particularly for
      non-responsive human tumors.

AB  - Immunosuppression is one of the common side effects of many anti-tumor agents
      targeting proliferating cells. We previously reported the development of a new
      class of pan-cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor compounds that induce
      immunosuppression in rodents. Here, we demonstrated that a pan-Cdk inhibitor,
      Compound 1 very rapidly reduced white blood cells in mice, only 8 h after
      administration. Compound 1 induced death of peripheral blood cells or purified
      resting (non-stimulated) lymphocytes ex vivo. Cell death was induced very
      rapidly, after 4 h of incubation, suggesting that acute immunosuppression
      observed in rodents might be, at least in part, due to direct cytotoxic effects
      of Compound 1 on resting lymphocytes. While cell cycle-related Cdks were not
      activated, the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA
      polymerase II was phosphorylated, indicating activation of Cdk7 or Cdk9, which
      phosphorylates this domain, in resting lymphocytes. Indeed, the pan-Cdk inhibitor
      suppressed CTD phosphorylation in resting cells at the dose required for cell
      death induction. Inhibition of Cdk7 or Cdk9 by Compound 1 was also confirmed by
      suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)-dependent transcription
      activity in the human cancer cell line U2OS. Interestingly, a Cdk4/6 inhibitor
      with selectivity against Cdk7 and Cdk9 did not induce cell death in resting
      lymphocytes. These results suggest that CTD phosphorylation possibly by Cdk7 or
      Cdk9 might be important for survival of resting lymphocytes and that Cdk
      inhibitors without inhibitory activity on these kinases might be an attractive
      agent for cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: SNS-032 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
      kinases (Cdks) 2, 7, and 9, with in vitro growth inhibitory effects and ability
      to induce apoptosis in malignant B cells. A phase I dose-escalation study of
      SNS-032 was conducted to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers of
      mechanism-based pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and clinical efficacy. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: Parallel cohorts of previously treated patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) received SNS-032 as a
      loading dose followed by 6-hour infusion weekly for 3 weeks of each 4-week
      course. RESULTS: There were 19 patients with CLL and 18 with MM treated. Tumor
      lysis syndrome was the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for CLL, the
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 75 mg/m(2), and the most frequent grade 3 to 4
      toxicity was myelosuppression. One patient with CLL had more than 50% reduction
      in measurable disease without improvement in hematologic parameters. Another
      patient with low tumor burden had stable disease for four courses. For patients
      with MM, no DLT was observed and MTD was not identified at up to 75 mg/m(2),
      owing to early study closure. Two patients with MM had stable disease and one had
      normalization of spleen size with treatment. Biomarker analyses demonstrated
      mechanism-based PD activity with inhibition of Cdk7 and Cdk9, decreases in Mcl-1 
      and XIAP expression level, and associated CLL cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: SNS-032
      demonstrated mechanism-based target modulation and limited clinical activity in
      heavily pretreated patients with CLL and MM. Further single-agent, PD-based, dose
      and schedule modification is warranted to maximize clinical efficacy.

TI  - Functional characterisation of cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) in colorectal
      cancer carcinogenesis.
PG  - 1752-61
LID - 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.04.007 [doi]
AB  - Cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) is a newly identified protein kinase homologous 
      to Cdk7. We have previously shown that CCRK is a candidate oncogene in human
      glioblastoma. However, whether CCRK is a bona fide oncogene remains to be tested.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CCRK in human colorectal
      cancer carcinogenesis. By Western blotting, we analysed the expression profile of
      CCRK protein in 10 colorectal cancer tissue samples and their adjacent normal
      colon tissues and in seven colorectal cancer cell lines. CCRK protein expression 
      was also investigated by immunohistochemistry in a colorectal tissue microarray, 
      which contained 120 cases of primary colorectal cancer and adjacent normal
      colorectal mucosa. The effects of CCRK knock-down on cell cycle profile and
      proliferation of colorectal cancer cells were examined by transfecting LoVo and
      DLD1 human colorectal cancer cell lines by either short-hairpin RNA (shCCRK) or
      small interfering RNA targeting CCRK (siCCRK). We found that CCRK protein levels 
      were elevated by more than 1.5-fold in 70% of colorectal cancer patient samples
      examined and CCRK was detectable in all seven colorectal cancer cell lines
      tested. Colorectal tissue microarray indicated that overexpression of CCRK was
      detected in 62/109 (56.9%) of informative colorectal cancer cases and was
      significantly associated with the tumour pT and pN status (p<0.05). Suppression
      of CCRK by siCCRK led to G1 phase cell cycle arrest and reduced cell growth.
      Consistently, stable clones of LoVo and DLD1 cells expressing shCCRK exhibited
      decreased cell proliferation rates. Furthermore, we showed that CCRK is required 
      for the phosphorylation of Cdk2 (on Thr-160) and Rb (on Ser-795) and the
      expression of cyclin E. These results suggest for the first time that CCRK is
      involved in colorectal cancer carcinogenesis and G1/S cell cycle transition by
      regulating Cdk2, cyclin E and Rb.

TI  - Cdc25 phosphatases are required for timely assembly of CDK1-cyclin B at the G2/M 
      transition.
PG  - 16978-90
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.096552 [doi]
AB  - Progression through mitosis requires the coordinated regulation of Cdk1 kinase
      activity. Activation of Cdk1 is a multistep process comprising binding of Cdk1 to
      cyclin B, relocation of cyclin-kinase complexes to the nucleus, activating
      phosphorylation of Cdk1 on Thr(161) by the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK; Cdk7 in
      metazoans), and removal of inhibitory Thr(14) and Tyr(15) phosphorylations. This 
      dephosphorylation is catalyzed by the dual specific Cdc25 phosphatases, which
      occur in three isoforms in mammalian cells, Cdc25A, -B, and -C. We find that
      expression of Cdc25A leads to an accelerated G(2)/M phase transition. In
      Cdc25A-overexpressing cells, Cdk1 exhibits high kinase activity despite being
      phosphorylated on Tyr(15). In addition, Tyr(15)-phosphorylated Cdk1 binds more
      cyclin B in Cdc25A-overexpressing cells compared with control cells. Consistent
      with this observation, we demonstrate that in human transformed cells, Cdc25A and
      Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C phosphatases have an effect on timing and efficiency of
      cyclin-kinase complex formation. Overexpression of Cdc25A or Cdc25B promotes
      earlier assembly and activation of Cdk1-cyclin B complexes, whereas repression of
      these phosphatases by short hairpin RNA has a reverse effect, leading to a
      substantial decrease in amounts of cyclin B-bound Cdk1 in G(2) and mitosis.
      Importantly, we find that Cdc25A overexpression leads to an activation of Cdk7
      and increase in Thr(161) phosphorylation of Cdk1. In conclusion, our data suggest
      that complex assembly and dephosphorylation of Cdk1 at G(2)/M is tightly coupled 
      and regulated by Cdc25 phosphatases.

      apoptosis in A549 cells.
PG  - 493-501
LID - 10.1007/s10637-010-9424-4 [doi]
AB  - Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) is a tubulin-binding compound currently in phase II
      trial as a tumor vascular-targeting agent. The present study evaluates the
      anti-tumor activities and establishes the mechanism of the action of
      4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-amine(XN0502), a
      novel synthesized CA-4 analogue, in an effort towards finding the favorable
      therapeutics of CA-4 derivatives. XN0502 is characterized by its more potent
      anti-proliferative activities against non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells
      (IC(50): 1.8 +/- 0.6 microM), than that on the normal human liver HL-7702 cells
      (IC(50): 9.1 +/- 0.4 microM). Of note, using tubulin polymerization assay,
      western blot and immuofluorescence analyses, XN0502 was showed to inhibit
      microtubule assembly at both molecular and cellular levels in A549 cells. Further
      studies indicated that XN0502 induced time- and dose-dependent G2/M arrest,
      accompanying with the reduction of CDC2/p34 expression and the downregulation of 
      CDK7. The protein level alteration and the nuclear translocation of cyclinB1 were
      observed, denoting the M phase arrest in XN0502-treated cells. Moreover, XN0502
      caused caspase-mediated apoptosis, as indicated by the cleavage of PARP, the
      reduction of procaspase-3 and procaspase-9, and the down-regulation of XIAP.
      Taken together, the current study demonstrates that the novel CA-4 analogue
      XN0502 is a promising anti-cancer agent with potent G2/M arrest- and
      apoptotic-inducing activities via targeting tubulin deserving further research
      and development, and helps provide data for exploiting new CA-4 analogues.

TI  - Drosophila Xpd regulates Cdk7 localization, mitotic kinase activity, spindle
      dynamics, and chromosome segregation.
PG  - e1000876
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000876 [doi]
AB  - The trimeric CAK complex functions in cell cycle control by phosphorylating and
      activating Cdks while TFIIH-linked CAK functions in transcription. CAK also
      associates into a tetramer with Xpd, and our analysis of young Drosophila embryos
      that do not require transcription now suggests a cell cycle function for this
      interaction. xpd is essential for the coordination and rapid progression of the
      mitotic divisions during the late nuclear division cycles. Lack of Xpd also
      causes defects in the dynamics of the mitotic spindle and chromosomal instability
      as seen in the failure to segregate chromosomes properly during ana- and
      telophase. These defects appear to be also nucleotide excision repair
      (NER)-independent. In the absence of Xpd, misrouted spindle microtubules attach
      to chromosomes of neighboring mitotic figures, removing them from their normal
      location and causing multipolar spindles and aneuploidy. Lack of Xpd also causes 
      changes in the dynamics of subcellular and temporal distribution of the CAK
      component Cdk7 and local mitotic kinase activity. xpd thus functions normally to 
      re-localize Cdk7(CAK) to different subcellular compartments, apparently removing 
      it from its cell cycle substrate, the mitotic Cdk. This work proves that the
      multitask protein Xpd also plays an essential role in cell cycle regulation that 
      appears to be independent of transcription or NER. Xpd dynamically localizes
      Cdk7/CAK to and away from subcellular substrates, thereby controlling local
      mitotic kinase activity. Possibly through this activity, xpd controls spindle
      dynamics and chromosome segregation in our model system. This novel role of xpd
      should also lead to new insights into the understanding of the neurological and
      cancer aspects of the human XPD disease phenotypes.

TI  - Separable functions of the fission yeast Spt5 carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) in
      capping enzyme binding and transcription elongation overlap with those of the RNA
      polymerase II CTD.
PG  - 2353-64

AB  - An interaction network connecting mRNA capping enzymes, the RNA polymerase II
      (Pol II) carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), elongation factor Spt5, and the Cdk7 and
      Cdk9 protein kinases is thought to comprise a transcription elongation
      checkpoint. A crux of this network is Spt5, which regulates early transcription
      elongation and has an imputed role in pre-mRNA processing via its physical
      association with capping enzymes. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Spt5 has a
      distinctive CTD composed of tandem nonapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence 
      (1)TPAWNSGSK(9). The Spt5 CTD binds the capping enzymes and is a substrate for
      threonine phosphorylation by the Cdk9 kinase. Here we report that deletion of the
      S. pombe Spt5 CTD results in slow growth and aberrant cell morphology. The
      severity of the spt5-DeltaCTD phenotype is exacerbated by truncation of the Pol
      II CTD and ameliorated by overexpression of the capping enzymes RNA
      triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase. These results suggest that the Spt5
      and Pol II CTDs play functionally overlapping roles in capping enzyme
      recruitment. We probed structure-activity relations of the Spt5 CTD by alanine
      scanning of the consensus nonapeptide. The T1A change abolished CTD
      phosphorylation by Cdk9 but did not affect CTD binding to the capping enzymes.
      The T1A and P2A mutations elicited cold-sensitive (cs) and temperature-sensitive 
      (ts) growth defects and conferred sensitivity to growth inhibition by 6-azauracil
      that was exacerbated by partial truncations of the Pol II CTD. The T1A phenotypes
      were rescued by a phosphomimetic T1E change but not by capping enzyme
      overexpression. These results imply a positive role for Spt5 CTD phosphorylation 
      in Pol Il transcription elongation in fission yeast, distinct from its capping
      enzyme interactions. Viability of yeast cells bearing both Spt5 CTD T1A and Pol
      II CTD S2A mutations heralds that the Cdk9 kinase has an essential target other
      than Spt5 and Pol II CTD-Ser2.

      cells and embryos.

LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.081687 [doi]
AB  - The trimeric Cdk7.cyclin H.Mat1 complex functions in cell cycle regulation, as
      the Cdk-activating kinase, and in transcription, as a module of the general
      transcription factor TFIIH. As a component of TFIIH, Cdk7 phosphorylates serines 
      5 and 7 of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and can also
      directly phosphorylate transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Here we
      have investigated the function of the Cdk7.cyclin H.Mat1 complex in murine
      embryonic stem (ES) cells and preimplantation embryos to determine whether it
      regulates the unique cell cycle structure and transcriptional network of
      pluripotent cells. We demonstrate that depletion of cyclin H leads to
      differentiation of ES cells independent of changes in cell cycle progression. In 
      contrast, we observed that developmental genes are acutely up-regulated after
      cyclin H down-regulation, likely perturbing normal ES self-renewal pathways. We
      further demonstrate that Spt5, a known phosphorylation target of Cdk7, similarly 
      regulates ES pluripotency and gene expression. Consistent with its function in ES
      cells, cyclin H depletion from mouse embryos also leads to defects in the
      expansion of the inner cell mass of blastocysts, a transient pluripotent stem
      cell population in vivo. Our findings indicate that cyclin H has an essential
      function in promoting the self-renewal of the pluripotent stem cells of
      blastocyst stage embryos. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a critical and 
      novel role for cyclin H in maintaining ES cell identity and suggest that cyclin H
      has important functions in early embryonic development.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as anticancer drugs.
PG  - 291-302
AB  - Poor therapeutic outcomes and serious side effects, together with acquired
      resistance to multiple drugs, are common problems of current cancer therapies.
      Therefore, there is an urgent need for new cancer-targeted drugs, which has led
      (inter alia) to the development of molecules that can specifically inhibit
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In addition to their cell cycle regulatory
      functions, CDKs, especially CDK7 and CDK9, play important roles in the regulation
      of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Here, we report on progress in the
      preclinical development of CDK inhibitors and their anticancer activities.
      Special attention is paid to the action mechanisms of the pan-specific CDK
      inhibitors flavopiridol and roscovitine, which have already entered phase II
      clinical trials as treatments for various tumours. The links between their
      ability to inhibit transcription and sensitisation of some types of cancer to
      apoptosis, mechanisms leading to p53 activation, and their synergistic
      cooperation with common DNA damaging drugs are also discussed. It has been
      demonstrated that drug-resistant cancer cells can arise during therapeutic
      application of small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. Clinical resistance to
      CDK inhibitors has not yet been described, but by comparing CDKs to other
      kinases, and CDK inhibitors to other clinically used protein kinase inhibitors,
      we also discuss possible mechanisms that could lead to resistance to CDK
      inhibitors.

TI  - Hypoxia promotes etoposide (VP-16) resistance in neuroblastoma CHP126 cells.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - Hypoxia is widespread in solid tumors as a consequence of poorly structured
      tumor-derived neovasculature, which is recognized to play a role in the
      resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Etoposide (VP-16), a drug commonly
      used in chemotherapy, leads to enhanced accumulation of cell populations in G2/M 
      phase and increases levels of apoptosis as a topoisomerase II inhibitor. We
      evaluated the effects of hypoxia on the response of the neuroblastoma cell line
      CHP126 to VP-16, in order to delineate the mechanisms responsible for the
      hypoxia-induced chemoresistance of this clinically conventional anti-cancer
      agent, with an insight to determining potential indications in neuroblastoma
      therapy. In this study, physiological hypoxia was shown to attenuate G2/M arrest 
      and apoptosis induced in CHP126 cells by VP-16. It suppressed drug-related Cdk1
      activity with a less elevation of regulator proteins such as cyclin B1, Cdk7 and 
      reduced caspase activation and PARP cleavage compared to the efficiency observed 
      in normoxic condition, which were significantly relative with hypoxia-driven
      inhibition of p53 and p-ERK1/2 activation. These results clearly demonstrated
      that hypoxia had a protective effect against VP-16-induced cytotoxicity, which is
      likely to provide a further therapeutic knowledge in neuroblastomas.

TI  - Rb inactivation in cell cycle and cancer: the puzzle of highly regulated
      activating phosphorylation of CDK4 versus constitutively active CDK-activating
      kinase.
PG  - 689-99
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 is a master integrator that couples
      mitogenic/oncogenic signalling cascades with the inactivation of the central
      oncosuppressor Rb and the cell cycle. Its activation requires binding to a D-type
      cyclin and then T-loop phosphorylation at T172 by the only identified
      CDK-activating kinase in animal cells, cyclin H-CDK7. In contrast with the
      observed constitutive activity of cyclin H-CDK7, we have recently identified the 
      T172-phosphorylation of cyclin D-bound CDK4 as a crucial cell cycle regulatory
      target. Intriguingly, the homologous T177-phosphorylation of CDK6 is weak in
      several systems and does not present this regulation. In this Perspective, we
      review the recent advances and debates on the multistep mechanism leading to
      activation of D-type cyclin-CDK4 complexes. This involves a re-evaluation of the 
      implication of Cip/Kip CDK "inhibitors" and CDK7 in this process.

TI  - CDKN1C negatively regulates RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphorylation
      in an E2F1-dependent manner.
PG  - 9813-22
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.091496 [doi]
AB  - CDKN1C is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and is a candidate tumor suppressor
      gene. We previously found that the CDKN1C protein represses E2F1-driven
      transcription in an apparent negative feedback loop. Herein, we explore the
      mechanism by which CDKN1C represses transcription. We find that
      adenoviral-mediated overexpression of CDKN1C leads to a dramatic reduction in
      phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD). RNA
      interference studies demonstrate that this activity is not an artifact of CDKN1C 
      overexpression, because endogenous CDKN1C mediates an inhibition of RNA pol II
      CTD phosphorylation in HeLa cells upon treatment with dexamethasone.
      Surprisingly, we find that CDKN1C-mediated repression of RNA pol II
      phosphorylation is E2F1-dependent, suggesting that E2F1 may direct CDKN1C to
      chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that CDKN1C is
      associated with E2F1-regulated promoters in vivo and that this association can
      dramatically reduce the level of RNA pol II CTD phosphorylation at both Ser-2 and
      Ser-5 of the C-terminal domain repeat. In addition, we show that CDKN1C interacts
      with both CDK7 and CDK9 (putative RNA pol II CTD kinases) and that CDKN1C blocks 
      their ability to phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase-CTD fusion protein in 
      vitro. E2F1 and CDKN1C are found to form stable complexes both in vivo and in
      vitro. Molecular studies demonstrate that the E2F1-CDKN1C interaction is mediated
      by two E2F domains. A central E2F1 domain interacts directly with CDKN1C, whereas
      a C-terminal E2F1 domain interacts with CDKN1C via interaction with Rb. The
      results presented in this report highlight a novel mechanism of tumor suppression
      by CDKN1C.

TI  - MONCPT exerts anti-cancer activities via inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis in
      human bladder cancer.
PG  - 823-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The potent anti-cancer capability of a novel CPT derivarate,
      10-methoxy-9-nitrocamptothecin (MONCPT), has been demonstrated in our previous
      studies. The present study focuses on the in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer
      activities, the cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-induction abilities of MONCPT on
      human bladder uroepithelial carcinoma 5637 cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MTT 
      assay and flow cytometric analyses were employed to evaluate the cell
      proliferation, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of MONCPT-treated 5637
      cells. Using 5637 xenografted nuce mice models, the in vivo anti-cancer
      capability of MONCPT were examined, as indicated by the decreased tumor volume
      and tumor weight. The effect of MONCPT on some of the key regulators of G2/M
      checkpoint and apoptosis, including CDKI-CDK-cyclin cascade, Kip1/p27 and
      Cip1/p21, PARP were examined using western blotting. RESULTS: The more potent
      anti-tumor activities of MONCPT than SN-38 against 5637 cells were indicated by
      the IC50 value (48 h) of 226.7 +/- 0.5 nM and 2031.0 +/- 0.5 nM, respectively.
      MONCPT treatment (0.1 microM) for 24 h caused the increment of G2/M population
      from 7.94% to 75.52%, indicating that MONCPT significantly triggered G2/M arrest.
      Moreover, MONCPT exposure (0.1 microM, 24 h) caused down-regulation of CDK7,
      p-Cdc2, and cyclinB1. Treatment with MONCPT (0.1 microM) for 48 h obviously
      induced apoptosis of 5637 cells, which was revealed by the accumulation of
      Annexin V-positive cells. The superior anti-tumor capabilities of MONCPT were
      further demonstrated in the human 5637 xenograft-bearing mice model. The
      administration of MONCPT at the dosages of 5, 10, 20 mg/kg for 15 days
      significantly inhibited the tumor growth with the inhibition rates of 64.8%,
      86.2% and 96.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study displayed the
      significant in vitro anti-proliferative abilities of MONCPT on human ladder
      cancer 5637 cells, and in vivo tumor-inhibitory activities on xenograft models.
      In addition, MONCPT was demonstrated to induce G2/M arrest and apoptosis in 5637 
      cells. Our findings provide evidences for the anti-tumor activity of MONCPT in
      the ongoing preclinical assessment.

AB  - Roscovitine and flavopiridol suppress cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and CDK9
      activity resulting in transcription inhibition, thus providing an alternative
      mechanism to traditional genotoxic chemotherapy. These agents have been effective
      in slow or nonreplicative cell types. 8-Amino-adenosine is a transcription
      inhibitor that has proved very effective in multiple myeloma cell lines and
      primary indolent leukemia cells. The objective of the current work was to define 
      mechanisms of action that lead to transcription inhibition by 8-amino-adenosine. 
      8-Amino-adenosine is metabolized into the active triphosphate (8-amino-ATP) in
      cells. This accumulation resulted in a simultaneous decrease of intracellular ATP
      and RNA synthesis. When the effects of established ATP synthesis inhibitors and
      transcription inhibitors on intracellular ATP concentrations and RNA synthesis
      were studied, there was a strong correlation between ATP decline and RNA
      synthesis. This correlation substantiated the hypothesis that the loss of ATP in 
      8-amino-adenosine-treated cells contributes to the decrease in transcription due 
      to the lack of substrate needed for mRNA body and polyadenylation tail synthesis.
      RNA polymerase II COOH terminal domain phosphorylation declined sharply in
      8-amino-adenosine-treated cells, which may have been due to the lack of an ATP
      phosphate donor or competitive inhibition with 8-amino-ATP at CDK7 and CDK9.
      Furthermore, 8-amino-ATP was incorporated into nascent RNA in a dose-dependent
      manner at the 3'-end resulting in transcription termination. Finally, in vitro
      transcription assays showed that 8-amino-ATP competes with ATP for incorporation 
      into mRNA. Collectively, we have concluded that 8-amino-adenosine elicits effects
      on multiple mechanisms of transcription, providing a new class of transcription
      inhibitors.

TI  - Combined genetic effect of CDK7 and ESR1 polymorphisms on breast cancer.
PG  - 737-42
LID - 10.1007/s10549-009-0640-6 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer development is related to genes regulating cell cycle progression
      such as CCND1, CDK7, and ESR1. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study
      to evaluate the role of genetic polymorphisms in these genes in breast cancer
      development among Korean women. Questionnaire data and samples were obtained from
      864 incident breast cancer cases and 723 controls recruited from 1995 to 2002.
      Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes were genotyped by
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
      [CCND1 Ex4-1G>A (rs9344), CDK7 Ex2-28C>T (rs2972388), ESR1 P325P Ex4-122G>C
      (rs1801132), and ESR1 T594T Ex8+229G>A (rs2228480)], and their associations with 
      breast cancer risk were assessed. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression analysis
      adjusted for age, education, age at the first full-term pregnancy, and family
      history of breast cancer. Women carrying the CDK7 TT genotype had increased risk 
      of breast cancer (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7). There was no significant association
      between breast cancer risk and the genetic polymorphisms of CCND1 and ESR1.
      However, when CDK7 and ESR1 P325P were combined, women carrying both the CDK7 TT 
      and ESR1 P325P CC genotypes showed increased breast cancer risk (OR, 1.7; 95% CI,
      1.1-2.5; P for trend, <0.01). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the
      combined genotypes of CDK7 and ESR1 are associated with breast cancer risk among 
      Korean women.

PG  - 1957-65
LID - 10.1517/13543780903418445 [doi]
AB  - Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) form a key part of the regulatory
      proteins that govern the cell cycle. Aberrancy in their function can lead to
      uncontrolled growth and proliferation of the cells which forms the basis of many 
      human diseases, especially cancers. Seliciclib (CYC202, R-roscovitine) is a
      second-generation CDK inhibitor that competes for ATP binding sites on these
      kinases, reducing tumor growth and inducing cell death. It is a direct inhibitor 
      of cyclin E/CDK2 and also has inhibitory effects on cyclin H/CDK7 and cyclin
      T/CDK9. Seliciclib leads to growth arrest and apoptosis of cell lines through
      activation of the p53 gene, inhibition of RNA processing and blockage of the RNA 
      polymerase II-dependent transcription, and reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins. 
      Seliciclib has good oral bioavailability, although its absorption is slowed by
      food. It is distributed rapidly to the body tissues and metabolized rapidly to a 
      carboxylated derivative that is excreted by the kidneys. The major adverse
      effects of seliciclib are electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia),
      gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, emesis, anorexia), fatigue, transient
      hyperglycemia, elevation of liver enzymes and reversible elevation of serum
      creatinine. At present, it is in Phase II trials for non-small cell lung cancer
      and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

LID - 10.1084/jem.20091892 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the XPD subunit of the DNA repair/transcription factor TFIIH result 
      in the rare recessive genetic disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Many XP
      patients are compound heterozygotes with a "causative" XPD point mutation R683W
      and different second mutant alleles, considered "null alleles." However, there is
      marked clinical heterogeneity (including presence or absence of skin cancers or
      neurological degeneration) in these XPD/R683W patients, thus suggesting a
      contribution of the second allele. Here, we report XP patients carrying XPD/R683W
      and a second XPD allele either XPD/Q452X, /I455del, or /199insPP. We performed a 
      systematic study of the effect of these XPD mutations on several enzymatic
      functions of TFIIH and found that each mutation exhibited unique biochemical
      properties. Although all the mutations inhibited the nucleotide excision repair
      (NER) by disturbing the XPD helicase function, each of them disrupted specific
      molecular steps during transcription: XPD/Q452X hindered the transactivation
      process, XPD/I455del disturbed RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, and
      XPD/199insPP inhibited kinase activity of the cdk7 subunit of TFIIH. The broad
      range and severity of clinical features in XP patients arise from a broad set of 
      deficiencies in NER and transcription that result from the combination of
      mutations found on both XPD alleles.

TI  - R-roscovitine (Seliciclib) affects CLL cells more strongly than combinations of
      fludarabine or cladribine with cyclophosphamide: Inhibition of CDK7 sensitizes
      leukemic cells to caspase-dependent apoptosis.
PG  - 217-35
LID - 10.1002/jcb.22400 [doi]
AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of
      malignant, apoptosis-resistant B CD19(+)/CD5(+) cells. Populations of CLL cells
      are heterogeneous and consist primarily of quiescent cells with a minor subset of
      dividing cells. In this study the efficacy of a first-line in vivo therapy was
      compared with treatment by R-roscovitine (ROSC) alone or by purine analogues
      (cladribine and fludarabine) combined with maphosphamide for 14 CLL patients
      under ex vivo conditions. ROSC induced the highest reduction in numbers of living
      B-cells, coinciding with an increased rate of apoptosis. After 24 h the
      percentage of apoptotic cells in ROSC-treated cultures was markedly higher than
      in untreated controls. ROSC also induced strong activation of the apoptosome and 
      effector caspases in CLL cells. During progression of apoptosis the plasma
      membrane became permeable, resulting in the release of activated caspases into
      the culture medium. Leukemic cells were more sensitive to ROSC than normal
      mononuclear cells. Treatment with ROSC did not affect the activating
      phosphorylation of CDK2 or CDK1. However, ROSC decreased phosphorylation of
      survivin, CDK7, and RNA-Pol II, resulting in inhibition of transcription
      elongation and subsequent down-regulation of levels of anti-apoptotic factors,
      thereby facilitating apoptosis. Unlike ROSC, two other purine analogues barely
      affected the cellular levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and more weakly activated
      effector caspases. In addition, the efficacies of in vivo and ex vivo therapies
      were found to be correlated. Marked between-patient differences in expression
      patterns of apoptosis-regulating factors in CLL cells were observed, explaining
      the variations in patients' sensitivity to therapy.

      established in a mediator-dependent fashion.
PG  - 188-96
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.046565 [doi]
AB  - The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal heptarepeat domain
      (CTD) is subject to phosphorylation during initiation and elongation of
      transcription by RNA polymerase II. Here we study the molecular mechanisms
      leading to phosphorylation of Ser-7 in the human enzyme. Ser-7 becomes
      phosphorylated before initiation of transcription at promoter regions. We
      identify cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) as one responsible kinase.
      Phosphorylation of both Ser-5 and Ser-7 is fully dependent on the cofactor
      complex Mediator. A subform of Mediator associated with an active RNAPII is
      critical for preinitiation complex formation and CTD phosphorylation. The
      Mediator-RNAPII complex independently recruits TFIIB and CDK7 to core promoter
      regions. CDK7 phosphorylates Ser-7 selectively in the context of an intact
      preinitiation complex. CDK7 is not the only kinase that can modify Ser-7 of the
      CTD. ChIP experiments with chemical inhibitors provide evidence that other yet to
      be identified kinases further phosphorylate Ser-7 in coding regions.

TI  - Cell cycle genes and ovarian cancer susceptibility: a tagSNP analysis.
PG  - 1461-8
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the cell cycle is a hallmark of many cancers
      including ovarian cancer, a leading cause of gynaecologic cancer mortality
      worldwide. METHODS: We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (n=288)
      from 39 cell cycle regulation genes, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases 
      (CDKs) and CDK inhibitors, in a two-stage study. White, non-Hispanic cases
      (n=829) and ovarian cancer-free controls (n=941) were genotyped using an Illumina
      assay. RESULTS: Eleven variants in nine genes (ABL1, CCNB2, CDKN1A, CCND3, E2F2, 
      CDK2, E2F3, CDC2, and CDK7) were associated with risk of ovarian cancer in at
      least one genetic model. Seven SNPs were then assessed in four additional studies
      with 1689 cases and 3398 controls. Association between risk of ovarian cancer and
      ABL1 rs2855192 found in the original population [odds ratio, OR(BB vs AA) 2.81
      (1.29-6.09), P=0.01] was also observed in a replication population, and the
      association remained suggestive in the combined analysis [OR(BB vs AA) 1.59
      (1.08-2.34), P=0.02]. No other SNP associations remained suggestive in the
      replication populations. CONCLUSION: ABL1 has been implicated in multiple
      processes including cell division, cell adhesion and cellular stress response.
      These results suggest that characterization of the function of genetic variation 
      in this gene in other ovarian cancer populations is warranted.

TI  - P53 and p38 MAPK pathways are involved in MONCPT-induced cell cycle G2/M arrest
      in human non-small cell lung cancer A549.
PG  - 437-45
LID - 10.1007/s00432-009-0674-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In previous research, we found that 10-methoxy-9-nitrocamptothecin
      (MONCPT) possessed potent anti-tumor activity in A549 cells in vitro and in vivo.
      In this paper, our purpose is to investigate the mechanism of MONCPT-induced cell
      cycle arrest in A549 cells. METHODS: Cell cycle distribution was measured using
      flow cytometry (FCM). Protein expression and RNA expression were analyzed by
      western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. SiRNA technology was introduced
      to silence the expression of p53 and p38. RESULTS: FCM showed that MONCPT induced
      cell cycle G2/M arrest in time- and dose-dependent manner. The levels of feedback
      loop proteins PLK-1, Cdc25C, and cyclinB1 were obviously increased from 12 to 24 
      h, and then reduced from 36 to 48 h by MONCPT (100.0 nM). Moreover,
      down-regulation of p-AKT in A549 cells was seen after treated with 100.0 nM
      MONCPT for 12-48 h. Over-expression of p53 and p21 in A549 cells treated with
      MONCPT was observed in time-dependent manner. When wild type p53 expression was
      specifically inhibited by RNA-interference, A549 cells treated with MONCPT
      delayed the onset of G2/M arrest; meanwhile p-ERK and Cdc2 were up-regulated
      while p21 and CDK7 were down-regulated in A549 cells treated with MONCPT and p53 
      SiRNA transfection in contrast to cells treated with 100.0 nM MONCPT alone. In
      addition, our results exhibited that MONCPT obviously down-regulated p-ERK, JNK, 
      p-JNK, and p-p38. Treatment with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      SiRNA obviously inhibited p38 MAPK and delayed the G2/M arrest induced by 50.0 nM
      MONCPT after 48 h. CONCLUSION: Cell cycle regulators, AKT, p53, and MAPK, as
      therapeutic targets for MONCPT to induce cell cycle G2/M arrest in the context of
      anticancer therapy.

TI  - Impact of roscovitine, a selective CDK inhibitor, on cancer cells:
      bi-functionality increases its therapeutic potential.
PG  - 495-501
AB  - Increased expression and activity of proteins driving cell cycle progression as
      well as inactivation of endogenous inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 
      enhance the proliferative potential of cells. Escape of cells during malignant
      transformation from the proper cell cycle control rendering them independent from
      growth factors provides rationale for therapeutic targeting of CDKs. Exposure of 
      rapidly growing human MCF-7 breast cancer and HeLa cervix cancer cells to
      roscovitine (ROSC), a selective inhibitor of CDKs, inhibits their proliferation
      by induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. The outcome strongly depends 
      on the intrinsic traits of the tumor cells, on their cell cycle status prior to
      the onset of treatment and also on ROSC concentration. At lower dose ROSC
      primarily inhibits the cell cycle-related CDKs resulting in a strong cell cycle
      arrest. Interestingly, ROSC arrests asynchronously growing cells at the G(2)/M
      transition irrespective of the status of their restriction checkpoint. However,
      the exposure of cancer cells synchronized after serum starvation in the late G(1)
      phase results in a transient G(1) arrest only in cells displaying the intact
      G(1)/S checkpoint. At higher dosage ROSC triggers apoptosis. In HeLa cells
      inhibition of the activity of CDK7 and, in consequence, that of RNA polymerase II
      is a major event that facilitates the initiation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. 
      In contrast, in the caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cells ROSC induces
      apoptosis by a p53-dependent pathway. HIPK2-mediated activation of the p53
      transcription factor by phosphorylation at Ser46 results in upregulation of
      p53AIP1 protein. This protein after de novo synthesis and translocation into the 
      mitochondria promotes depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane.

AB  - Despite advances in screening and treatment, colorectal cancer remains the second
      leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Cyclin-dependent
      kinases (Cdk) are deregulated in colorectal cancer by silencing of the Cdk
      inhibitor p16(Ink4a) and other mechanisms. We tested whether the small molecule
      Cdk inhibitor SNS-032 (formerly BMS-387032), which targets Cdk2, Cdk7, and Cdk9, 
      can prevent intestinal tumorigenesis in mouse models. We generated mice with high
      intestinal tumor loads by combining the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min)
      mutation with Ink4a/Arf mutations and inducing colitis with dextran sulfate
      sodium. p16-null Min mice (n = 17) began dextran sulfate sodium treatment at week
      5 and i.p. injection of carrier or SNS-032 at week 6. Mice were sacrificed at
      week 12. SNS-032 was well tolerated and reduced colon tumor burden to 36% of that
      in carrier-treated mice (P < 0.001). We then extended the study to Ink4/Arf-null 
      Min mice (n = 14) and increased the drug dose frequency. SNS-032 treatment
      reduced the intestinal tumor number to 25% and intestinal tumor burden to 16% of 
      carrier-treated mice (P < 0.0001). DNA synthesis in non-neoplastic and tumor
      epithelial cells, detected by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, was modestly
      reduced by acute SNS-032 treatment. The mitotic index, detected by histone H3
      phosphorylation, was distinctly decreased (P < 0.03), and apoptosis, detected by 
      caspase 3 activation, was increased (P < 0.005). These results show the
      chemoprevention of intestinal tumorigenesis by SNS-032. Our findings support
      further study of Cdk inhibitors for chemoprevention and therapy of colon cancer.

AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family is emerging as an important therapeutic 
      target in the treatment of cancer. Cdks 1, 2, 4, and 6 are the key members that
      regulate the cell cycle, as opposed to Cdks that control processes such as
      transcription (Cdk7 and Cdk9). For this reason, Cdks 1, 2, 4, and 6 have been the
      subject of extensive cell cycle-related research, and consequently many
      inhibitors have been developed to target these proteins. However, the compounds
      that comprise the current list of Cdk inhibitors are largely ATP-competitive.
      Here we report the identification of a novel structural site on Cdk2, which is
      well conserved between the cell cycle Cdks. Small molecules identified by a high 
      throughput in silico screen of this pocket exhibit cytostatic effects and act by 
      reducing the apparent protein levels of cell cycle Cdks. Drug-induced cell cycle 
      arrest is associated with decreased Rb phosphorylation and decreased expression
      of E2F-dependent genes. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the primary
      mechanism of action of these compounds is the direct induction of Cdk1, Cdk2, and
      Cdk4 protein aggregation.

TI  - TFIIH-associated Cdk7 kinase functions in phosphorylation of C-terminal domain
      Ser7 residues, promoter-proximal pausing, and termination by RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 5455-64
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00637-09 [doi]
AB  - The function of human TFIIH-associated Cdk7 in RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
      transcription and C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation was investigated in
      analogue-sensitive Cdk7(as/as) mutant cells where the kinase can be inhibited
      without disrupting TFIIH. We show that both Cdk7 and Cdk9/PTEFb contribute to
      phosphorylation of Pol II CTD Ser5 residues on transcribed genes. Cdk7 is also a 
      major kinase of CTD Ser7 on Pol II at the c-fos and U snRNA genes. Furthermore,
      TFIIH and recombinant Cdk7-CycH-Mat1 as well as recombinant Cdk9-CycT1
      phosphorylated CTD Ser7 and Ser5 residues in vitro. Inhibition of Cdk7 in vivo
      suppressed the amount of Pol II accumulated at 5' ends on several genes including
      c-myc, p21, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, indicating
      reduced promoter-proximal pausing or polymerase "leaking" into the gene.
      Consistent with a 5' pausing defect, Cdk7 inhibition reduced recruitment of the
      negative elongation factor NELF at start sites. A role of Cdk7 in regulating
      elongation is further suggested by enhanced histone H4 acetylation and diminished
      histone H4 trimethylation on lysine 36-two marks of elongation-within genes when 
      the kinase was inhibited. Consistent with a new role for TFIIH at 3' ends, it was
      detected within genes and 3'-flanking regions, and Cdk7 inhibition delayed
      pausing and transcription termination.

PG  - 6208-15
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0301 [doi]
AB  - Normal progression through the cell cycle requires the sequential action of
      cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Direct or indirect
      deregulation of CDK activity is a feature of almost all cancers and has led to
      the development of CDK inhibitors as anticancer agents. The CDK-activating kinase
      (CAK) plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle by mediating the activating 
      phosphorylation of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. As such, CDK7, which also
      regulates transcription as part of the TFIIH basal transcription factor, is an
      attractive target for the development of anticancer drugs. Computer modeling of
      the CDK7 structure was used to design potential potent CDK7 inhibitors. Here, we 
      show that a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-derived compound, BS-181, inhibited CAK
      activity with an IC(50) of 21 nmol/L. Testing of other CDKs as well as another 69
      kinases showed that BS-181 only inhibited CDK2 at concentrations lower than 1
      micromol/L, with CDK2 being inhibited 35-fold less potently (IC(50) 880 nmol/L)
      than CDK7. In MCF-7 cells, BS-181 inhibited the phosphorylation of CDK7
      substrates, promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to inhibit the growth of
      cancer cell lines, and showed antitumor effects in vivo. The drug was stable in
      vivo with a plasma elimination half-life in mice of 405 minutes after i.p.
      administration of 10 mg/kg. The same dose of drug inhibited the growth of MCF-7
      human xenografts in nude mice. BS-181 therefore provides the first example of a
      potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor with potential as an anticancer agent.

AB  - Combination therapy, using agents that target the microenvironment as well as the
      cancer cells, is common in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Here, we show
      that a 6-week course of weekly sequential administration of the cytotoxic drug
      doxorubicin (2 mg/kg), followed 24 hr later by the antiresorptive agent
      zoledronic acid (100 microg/kg), causes substantial inhibition of subcutaneous
      MDA-MB-436 breast tumor growth in immunocompromised mice, leading to
      significantly increased survival. Tumor growth did not resume following
      withdrawal of treatment after 6 weeks, with 60% of the animals in this group
      surviving for more than 160 days. In comparison, animals receiving single-agent
      therapy all died within 50 days. Molecular analysis of the tumors showed no
      effect on cell cycle or apoptosis following administration of 100 microg/kg
      zoledronic acid or 2 mg/kg doxorubicin alone. When doxorubicin was administered
      24 hr before zoledronic acid, tumors displayed decreased expression of CYCLINS
      E1, B, D1 and D3 as well as CDK2, CDC2, CDK4 and CDK7, indicative of cell-cycle
      inhibition. Tumors from animals receiving sequential treatment also showed
      induction of both intrinsic- and extrinsic-apoptotic pathways, with increased
      expression of BAX, decreased expression of BCL-2 and activation of CASPASE 3, 8
      and 9. Accumulation of the unprenylated form of RAP1a, a surrogate marker for
      uptake of zoledronic acid, was only detected in tumors from animals treated with 
      doxorubicin 24 hr before zoledronic acid. Our data are the first to show a
      sustained antitumor effect in vivo following a limited course of sequential
      administration of doxorubicin followed by zoledronic acid.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently includes abnormalities in cell cycle
      regulators, including up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdks) activities due 
      to loss or low expression of Cdk inhibitors. In this study, we show that
      xylocydine, a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) specific inhibitor, is a good
      anti-cancer drug candidate for HCC treatment. Xylocydine (50muM) selectively
      down-regulates the activity of Cdk1 and Cdk2, accompanied by significant cell
      growth inhibition in HCC cells. Xylocydine also strongly inhibits the activity of
      Cdk7 and Cdk9, in vitro as well as in cell cultures, that is temporally
      associated with apoptotic cell death in xylocydine-induced HCC cells. This is
      associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II at serine
      residues 5 and 2, which are targets of Cdk7 and Cdk9, respectively. The effects
      on apoptosis are concomitant with changes in the levels of anti-apoptotic
      proteins, Bcl-2, XIAP, and survivin, which are markedly down-regulated, and
      pro-apoptotic molecules, p53 and Bax, which are elevated in HCC cells after
      treatment with xylocydine. The up-regulated level of p53 was associated with
      increased stability of the protein, as levels of Ser15 and Ser392 phsophorylated 
      p53 are similarly elevated in the inhibitor treated cells. We demonstrated that
      xylocydine can effectively suppress the growth of HCC xenografts in Balb/C-nude
      mice by preferentially inducing apoptosis in the xenografts, whereas the drug did
      not cause any apparent toxic effect on other tissues. Taken together, these data 
      suggest that the novel Cdk inhibitor xylocydine is a good candidate for an
      anti-cancer drug for HCC therapy.

TI  - Inhibition of CDKS by roscovitine suppressed LPS-induced *NO production through
      inhibiting NFkappaB activation and BH4 biosynthesis in macrophages.
PG  - C742-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00138.2009 [doi]
AB  - In inflammatory diseases, tissue damage is critically associated with nitric
      oxide ((*)NO) and cytokines, which are overproduced in response to cellular
      release of endotoxins. Here we investigated the inhibitory effect of roscovitine,
      a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) on (*)NO production in
      mouse macrophages. In RAW264.7 cells, we found that roscovitine abolished the
      production of (*)NO induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, roscovitine
      significantly inhibited LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA
      and protein expression. Our data also showed that roscovitine attenuated
      LPS-induced phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), IkappaB, and p65
      but enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase
      (JNK). In addition, roscovitine dose dependently inhibited LPS-induced expression
      of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX)-2, IL-1beta, and IL-6 but not tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor for iNOS, is
      easily oxidized to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH(2)). Roscovitine significantly
      inhibited LPS-induced BH(4) biosynthesis and decreased BH(4)-to-BH(2) ratio.
      Furthermore, roscovitine greatly reduced the upregulation of GTP cyclohydrolase-1
      (GCH-1), the rate-limiting enzyme for BH(4) biosynthesis. Using other CDK
      inhibitors, we found that CDK1, CDK5, and CDK7, but not CDK2, significantly
      inhibited LPS-induced (*)NO production in macrophages. Similarly, in isolated
      peritoneal macrophages, roscovitine strongly inhibited (*)NO production, iNOS,
      and COX-2 upregulation, activation of NFkappaB, and induction of GCH-1 by LPS.
      Together, our data indicate that roscovitine abolishes LPS-induced (*)NO
      production in macrophages by suppressing nuclear factor-kappaB activation and
      BH(4) biosynthesis, which might be mediated by CDK1, CDK5, and CDK7. Our results 
      also suggest that roscovitine may inhibit inflammation and that CDKs may play
      important roles in the mechanisms by which roscovitine attenuates inflammation.

TI  - A role for Chk1 in blocking transcriptional elongation of p21 RNA during the
      S-phase checkpoint.
PG  - 1364-77
LID - 10.1101/gad.1795709 [doi]
AB  - We reported previously that when cells are arrested in S phase, a subset of p53
      target genes fails to be strongly induced despite the presence of high levels of 
      p53. When DNA replication is inhibited, reduced p21 mRNA accumulation is
      correlated with a marked reduction in transcription elongation. Here we show that
      ablation of the protein kinase Chk1 rescues the p21 transcription elongation
      defect when cells are blocked in S phase, as measured by increases in both p21
      mRNA levels and the presence of the elongating form of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)
      toward the 3' end of the p21 gene. Recruitment of specific elongation and 3'
      processing factors (DSIF, CstF-64, and CPSF-100) is also restored. While
      additional components of the RNAPII transcriptional machinery, such as TFIIB and 
      CDK7, are recruited more extensively to the p21 locus after DNA damage than after
      replication stress, their recruitment is not enhanced by ablation of Chk1.
      Significantly, ablating Chk2, a kinase closely related in substrate specificity
      to Chk1, does not rescue p21 mRNA levels during S-phase arrest. Thus, Chk1 has a 
      direct and selective role in the elongation block to p21 observed during S-phase 
      arrest. These findings demonstrate for the first time a link between the
      replication checkpoint mediated by ATR/Chk1 and the transcription elongation/3'
      processing machinery.

TI  - Differential regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6, evidence
      that CDK4 might not be activated by CDK7, and design of a CDK6 activating
      mutation.
PG  - 4188-200
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01823-08 [doi]
AB  - The homologous cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) CDK4 and CDK6 integrate mitogenic
      and oncogenic signaling cascades with the cell cycle. Their activation requires
      binding to a D-type cyclin and then T-loop phosphorylation at T172 and T177
      (respectively) by the only CDK-activating kinase identified in animal cells,
      cyclin H-CDK7. At odds with the existing data showing the constitutive activity
      of CDK7, we have recently identified the T172 phosphorylation of cyclin D-bound
      CDK4 as a crucial cell cycle regulatory target. Here we show that T172
      phosphorylation of CDK4 is conditioned by its unique proline 173 residue. In
      contrast to CDK4, CDK6 does not contain such a proline and, unexpectedly,
      remained poorly phosphorylated and active in a variety of cells. Mutations of
      proline 173 did not adversely affect CDK4 activation by CDK7, but in cells they
      abolished CDK4 T172 phosphorylation and activity. Conversely, substituting a
      proline for the corresponding residue of CDK6 enforced its complete, apparently
      cyclin-independent T177 phosphorylation and dramatically increased its activity. 
      These results lead us to propose that CDK4 might not be phosphorylated by CDK7 in
      intact cells but is more likely phosphorylated by another, presumably
      proline-directed kinase(s). Moreover, they provide a new model of a potentially
      oncogenic activating mutation of a CDK.

AB  - Posttranslational modifications of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the
      largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) specify a molecular recognition
      code that is deciphered by proteins involved in RNA biogenesis. The CTD is
      comprised of a repeating heptapeptide (Y(1)S(2)P(3)T(4)S(5)P(6)S(7)). Recently,
      phosphorylation of serine 7 was shown to be important for cotranscriptional
      processing of two snRNAs in mammalian cells. Here we report that Kin28/Cdk7, a
      subunit of the evolutionarily conserved TFIIH complex, is a Ser7 kinase. The
      ability of Kin28/Cdk7 to phosphorylate Ser7 is particularly surprising because
      this kinase functions at promoters of protein-coding genes, rather than being
      restricted to promoter-distal regions of snRNA genes. Kin28/Cdk7 is also known to
      phosphorylate Ser5 residues of the CTD at gene promoters. Taken together, our
      results implicate the TFIIH kinase in placing bivalent Ser5 and Ser7 marks early 
      in gene transcription. These bivalent CTD marks, in concert with cues within
      nascent transcripts, specify the cotranscriptional engagement of the relevant RNA
      processing machinery.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death among men in
      the USA. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the role of atypical protein
      kinase C-iota (PKC-iota) in androgen independent prostate DU-145 carcinoma
      cellscompared to transformed non-malignant prostate RWPE-1 cells. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Western blotting and immunoprecipitations demonstrated that
      PKC-iotaisassociated with cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase (CAK/Cdk7) in
      RWPE-1 cells, but not in DU-145 cells. RESULTS: Treatment of prostate RWPE-1
      cells with PKC-iota silencing RNA (siRNA) decreased cell viability,cell-cycle
      accumulation at G2/M phase, and phosphorylation of Cdk7 and Cdk2. In addition,
      PKC-iota siRNA treatment caused less phosphorylation ofBad at ser-155, ser-136,
      and greater Bad/Bcl-xL heterodimerization, leading to apoptosis. In DU-145 cells,
      PKC-iota was anti-apoptotic and was required for cell survival. Treatment with
      PKC-iota siRNA blocked increase in cell number, and inhibited G1/S transition by 
      accumulation of cells in G0/G1phase. In addition to cell-cycle arrest, both
      RWPE-1 and DU-145 cells underwent apoptosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction and 
      apoptosis cascades, such as release of cytochrome c,activation of caspase-7, and 
      poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that
      PKC-iota is required for cell survival in both transformed non-malignant prostate
      RWPE-1 cells and androgen-independent malignant prostate DU-145 cells, whereas
      suppressing PKC-iota lead to apoptosis in DU-145 prostate cells.

TI  - Mechanism of action of SNS-032, a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 4637-45
LID - 10.1182/blood-2008-12-190256 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) have been reported to have
      activities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by inhibiting Cdk7 and Cdk9,
      which control transcription. Here we studied the novel Cdk inhibitor SNS-032,
      which exhibits potent and selective inhibitory activity against Cdk2, Cdk7, and
      Cdk9. We hypothesized that transient inhibition of transcription by SNS-032 would
      decrease antiapoptotic proteins, resulting in cell death. SNS-032 effectively
      killed chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro regardless of prognostic
      indicators and treatment history. This was associated with inhibition of
      phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and inhibition of RNA synthesis. Consistent 
      with the intrinsic turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins,
      antiapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
      (XIAP), were rapidly reduced on exposure to SNS-032, whereas Bcl-2 protein was
      not affected. The initial decrease of Mcl-1 protein was the result of
      transcriptional inhibition rather than cleavage by caspase. Compared with
      flavopiridol and roscovitine, SNS-032 was more potent, both in inhibition of RNA 
      synthesis and at induction of apoptosis. SNS-032 activity was readily reversible;
      removal of SNS-032 reactivated RNA polymerase II, which led to resynthesis of
      Mcl-1 and cell survival. Thus, these data support the clinical development of
      SNS-032 in diseases that require short-lived oncoproteins for survival.

      modulator, in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal cancer.
PG  - 1435-42
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1748 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cell cycle dysregulation resulting in expression of antiapoptotic genes 
      and uncontrolled proliferation is a feature of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. The pharmacodynamic effects of seliciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase
      (CDK) inhibitor, were studied in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with treatment-naive locally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma received seliciclib at 800 mg or 400 mg twice daily on
      days 1 to 3 and 8 to 12. Paired tumor samples obtained at baseline and on day 13 
      were assessed by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and transcriptional
      profiling using real-time PCR low-density array consisting of a panel of 380
      genes related to cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis, signal transduction, and cell 
      proliferation. RESULTS: At 800 mg bd, one patient experienced grade 3 liver
      toxicity and another had grade 2 vomiting; no significant toxicities were
      experienced in 13 patients treated at 400 mg bd. Seven of fourteen evaluable
      patients had clinical evidence of tumor reduction. Some of these responses were
      associated with increased tumor apoptosis, necrosis, and decreases in plasma EBV 
      DNA posttreatment. Reduced protein expression of Mcl-1, cyclin D1, phosphorylated
      retinoblastoma protein pRB (T821), and significant transcriptional
      down-regulation of genes related to cellular proliferation and survival were
      shown in some patients posttreatment, indicative of cell cycle modulation by
      seliciclib, more specifically inhibition of cdk2/cyclin E, cdk7/cyclin H, and
      cdk9/cyclin T. CONCLUSIONS: Brief treatment with this regimen of seliciclib in
      patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma is tolerable at 400 mg bd and associated
      with tumor pharmacodynamic changes consistent with cdk inhibition, and warrants
      further efficacy studies in this tumor.

TI  - Characterization of ScMat1, a putative TFIIH subunit from sugarcane.
PG  - 663-72
LID - 10.1007/s00299-008-0663-1 [doi]
AB  - The general transcription factor TFIIH is a multiprotein complex with different
      enzymatic activities such as helicase, protein kinase and DNA repair. MAT1
      (menage a trois 1) is one of the TFIIH subunits that has kinase activity and it
      is the third subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase
      (CAK), CDK7- cyclin H. The main objective of this work was to characterize
      ScMAT1, a sugarcane gene encoding a MAT1 homolog. Northern blots and in situ
      hybridization results showed that ScMAT1 was expressed in sugarcane mature leaf, 
      leaf roll and inflorescence, and it was not differentially expressed in any of
      the other tissues analyzed such us bud and roots. In addition, ScMAT1 was not
      differentially expressed during different stress conditions and treatment with
      hormones. In situ hybridization analyses also showed that ScMAT1 was expressed in
      different cell types during leaf development. In order to identify proteins that 
      interact with ScMAT1, a yeast two hybrid assay with ScMAT1 as bait was used to
      screen a sugarcane leaf cDNA library. The screening of yeast two hybrids yielded 
      14 positive clones. One of them is a cytochrome p450 family protein involved in
      oxidative degradation of toxic compounds. Other clones isolated are also related 
      to plant responses to stress. To determine the subcellular localization of
      ScMAT1, a ScMAT1-GFP fusion was assayed in onion epidermal cell and the
      fluorescence was localized to the nucleus, in agreement with the putative role of
      ScMAT1 as a basal transcription factor.

      spatially and temporally coordinated events. Previous work had established that
      the CTD binds DNA but the significance of this interaction has not been
      determined. The present work shows that the CTD binds DNA in its unphosphorylated
      form, the form in which it is present in the pre-initiation complex. The CTD/DNA 
      complex is recognized by and is phosphorylated by Cdk7 but not by Cdk9.
      Model-building studies indicate the structural mechanism underlying such
      specificity involves interaction of Cdk7 with DNA in the context of the CTD/DNA
      complex. The model has been tested by mutagenesis experiments. CTD dissociates
      from DNA following phosphorylation by Cdk7, allowing transcription initiation.
      The CTD then becomes accessible for further phosphorylation by Cdk9 that drives
      the transition to transcription elongation.

TI  - A coordinated phosphorylation cascade initiated by p38MAPK/MSK1 directs RARalpha 
      to target promoters.
PG  - 34-47
LID - 10.1038/emboj.2008.256 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear retinoic acid (RA) receptor alpha (RARalpha) is a transcriptional
      transregulator that controls the expression of specific gene subsets through
      binding at response elements and dynamic interactions with coregulators, which
      are coordinated by the ligand. Here, we highlighted a novel paradigm in which the
      transcription of RARalpha target genes is controlled by phosphorylation cascades 
      initiated by the rapid RA activation of the p38MAPK/MSK1 pathway. We demonstrate 
      that MSK1 phosphorylates RARalpha at S369 located in the ligand-binding domain,
      allowing the binding of TFIIH and thereby phosphorylation of the N-terminal
      domain at S77 by cdk7/cyclin H. MSK1 also phosphorylates histone H3 at S10.
      Finally, the phosphorylation cascade initiated by MSK1 controls the recruitment
      of RARalpha/TFIIH complexes to response elements and subsequently RARalpha target
      gene activation. Cancer cells characterized by a deregulated p38MAPK/MSK1
      pathway, do not respond to RA, outlining the essential contribution of the
      RA-triggered phosphorylation cascade in RA signalling.

TI  - p27Kip1 inhibits cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4 by two independent modes.
PG  - 986-99
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00898-08 [doi]
AB  - Cell cycle progression is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk's), which in
      turn are regulated by their interactions with stoichiometric inhibitors, such as 
      p27(Kip1). Although p27 associates with cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4)
      constitutively, whether or not it inhibits this complex is dependent on the
      absence or presence of a specific tyrosine phosphorylation that converts p27 from
      a bound inhibitor to a bound noninhibitor under different growth conditions. This
      phosphorylation occurs within the 3-10 helix of p27 and may dislodge the helix
      from cdk4's active site to allow ATP binding. Here we show that the interaction
      of nonphosphorylated p27 with cdk4 also prevents the activating phosphorylation
      of the T-loop by cyclin H-cdk7, the cdk-activating kinase (CAK). Even though the 
      cyclin H-cdk7 complex is present and active in contact-arrested cells, p27's
      association with cyclin D-cdk4 prevents T-loop phosphorylation. When p27 is
      tyrosine phosphorylated in proliferating cells or in vitro with the tyrosine Y
      kinase Abl, phosphorylation of cdk4 by cyclin H-cdk7 is permitted, even without
      dissociation of p27. This suggests that upon release from the contact-arrested
      state, a temporal order for the reactivation of inactive p27-cyclin D-cdk4
      complexes must exist: p27 must be Y phosphorylated first, directly permitting
      cyclin H-cdk7 phosphorylation of residue T172 and the consequent restoration of
      kinase activity. The non-Y-phosphorylated p27-cyclin D-cdk4 complex could be
      phosphorylated by purified Csk1, a single-subunit CAK from fission yeast, but was
      still inactive due to p27's occlusion of the active site. Thus, the two modes by 
      which p27 inhibits cyclin D-cdk4 are independent and may reinforce one another to
      inhibit kinase activity in contact-arrested cells, while maintaining a reservoir 
      of preformed complex that can be activated rapidly upon cell cycle reentry.

TI  - DNA-Bound peptides control the mRNA transcription through CDK7.
PG  - 681-8
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.11.008 [doi]
AB  - The degradation of intracytosolic proteins has been well described. However, the 
      degradation pathway and physiological functions of the DNA-Bound peptides, which 
      are free of degradation by peptidase of the post-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway,
      are still unclear. In this study, the DNA-Bound peptides were isolated from
      barley germ and two main fractions of about 25 different peptides were obtained. 
      The DNA-Bound peptides were found to inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cells in a
      series of experiments. The DNA-Bound peptides also significantly inhibited in
      vitro and in vivo DNA transcription activity by regulating the expression and the
      corresponding functions of CDK7. Furthermore, signaling issues involving NFkappaB
      and ERK1/2 were observed. Such data suggests that DNA transcription could be
      inhibited by the DNA-Bound peptides via the CDK7 pathway. Thus we concluded that 
      some of the post-proteasomal peptides were involved in the regulation of
      eukaryotic mRNA transcription.

TI  - Transient treatment with CDK inhibitors eliminates proliferative potential even
      when their abilities to evoke apoptosis and DNA damage are blocked.
PG  - 3898-907
AB  - Transient treatment with small molecule CDK inhibitors is toxic to cancer cells
      and leads to depletion of anti-apoptotic proteins and Chk1, coupled with DNA
      damage and induction of apoptosis. Here we have examined, which of these
      phenomena are necessary for CDK inhibitors to have an anti-proliferative effect. 
      We find that 24 hours treatment with either a primarily CDK2-specific, or a
      primarily CDK7/9-specific, antagonist eliminates proliferative potential even if 
      apoptosis is blocked and the tendency of CDK inhibition to result in DNA damage
      is overcome by expression of recombinant Chk1. Loss of proliferative potential is
      correlated with irreversible suppression of biomarkers of cell cycle progression.
      CDK inhibitors dramatically reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 
      and XIAP, but siRNA-mediated suppression of Mcl-1 and XIAP did not induce cell
      death in the osteosarcoma cells used in this study. Finally, we found that many
      literature CDK inhibitors do not effectively suppress the CDK/cyclin complexes
      responsible for cell cycle progression at the minimum doses required to block
      proliferation: some are only effective after a substantial delay and may act via 
      inhibition of CDK7.

TI  - [Mechanism of regulation of hepatoma cell cycle by XPD/P44 subcomplex : an in
      vitro experiment].
PG  - 1997-2001
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of xeroderma pigmentosum group D(XPD)/P44
      subcomplex on the cell cycle of the hepatoma cells. METHODS: Human hematoma cells
      of the line SMMC-7721 were cultured and transfected with human XPD gene by
      Lipofectamine and 2 strains with stably transfected plasmid pEGFG-N2 and stably
      transfected recombinant plasmid pEGFG-N2/XPD were selected. After stably
      transfection,the antisense oligonucleotides of P44 were added to treat the stably
      transfected cells. The cells were divided into 6 groups: Group (1) (control
      group), Group (2) transfected with the blank plasmid pEGFP-N2, Group (3)
      transfected with the recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N2/XPD, Group (4) transfected with
      ASODN complementary to the translation initiation site of pEGFP-N2/XPD, Group (5)
      transfected with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODN) complementary to the
      translation terminal site of pEGFP-N2/XPD, and Group (6) transfected with ASODN
      complementary to the translation exon5 site of pEGFP-N2/XPD. The expression
      levels of wild-type P44, XPD, cdk7, cdk2, c-myc, and cdc25A were detected by
      RT-PCR and Western blotting. The cell growth and the cell cycle were examined by 
      MTT and flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: The P44 and XPD mRNA expression levels of 
      Group (4) were significantly higher than those of Groups (1) and (2) (both P <
      0.01). Western blotting indicated that the changes of P44 and XPD protein
      expression levels were consistent with those of their mRNAs respectively; while
      the mRNA and protein expression levels of cdk7, cdk2, c-myc, and cdc25A were all 
      decreased. MTF method showed that the hepatoma cells grew slowly, FCM showed that
      the number of the cells arrested at the G1 stage of Group (3) were higher than
      those of Groups (1) and (2). After the blockage of P44 gene expression, the
      expression levels of XPD mRNA and protein were decreased. The XPD mRNA and
      protein expression levels of Groups (4), (5), and (6) were significantly higher
      than those of Group (3) (all P < 0.01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of
      cdk7, cdk2, c-myc, and cdc25A were upregulated. MT method indicated that cells
      grew fast. FCM showed that the numbers of the cells arrested at the G1 stage of
      Group (4), (5), and (6) were all lower than that of Group ((3) The expression
      levels of cell cycle regulatory genes including cdk7, cdk2, c-myc, and cdc25A
      were markedly decreased,the hepatoma cells grew slowly; after the blockage of P44
      gene expression the expression levels of XPD mRNA and protein were decreased,
      whereas the expression levels of the cell cycle regulatory genes mentioned above 
      were enhanced, and the hepatoma cells grew faster. CONCLUSION: XPD gene inhibits 
      the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of hepatoma cells. The expression of
      XPD may be regulated by its molecular partner P44. XPD/P44 subcomplex is involved
      in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint.

AB  - In metazoans, different cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bind preferred cyclin
      partners to coordinate cell division. Here, we investigate these preferences in
      human cells and show that cyclin A assembles with Cdk1 only after complex
      formation with Cdk2 reaches a plateau during late S and G2 phases. To understand 
      the basis for Cdk2's competitive advantage, despite Cdk1's greater abundance, we 
      dissect their activation pathways by chemical genetics. Cdk1 and Cdk2 are
      activated by kinetically distinct mechanisms, even though they share the same
      CDK-activating kinase (CAK), Cdk7. We recapitulate cyclin A's selectivity for
      Cdk2 in extracts and override it with a yeast CAK that phosphorylates monomeric
      Cdk1, redirecting Cdk1 into a pathway normally restricted to Cdk2. Conversely,
      upon Cdk7 inhibition in vivo, cyclin B, which normally binds Cdk1 nearly
      exclusively, is diverted to Cdk2. Therefore, differential ordering of common
      activation steps promotes CDK-cyclin specificity, with Cdk7 acting catalytically 
      to enforce fidelity.

TI  - SUMOylation inhibits SF-1 activity by reducing CDK7-mediated serine 203
      phosphorylation.
PG  - 613-25
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00295-08 [doi]
AB  - Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor selectively expressed
      in the adrenal cortex and gonads, where it mediates the hormonal stimulation of
      multiple genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis. SF-1 is the target of
      both phosphorylation and SUMOylation, but how these modifications interact or
      contribute to SF-1 regulation of endogenous genes remains poorly defined. We
      found that SF-1 is selectively SUMOylated at K194 in Y1 adrenocarcinoma cells and
      that although SUMOylation does not alter the subcellular localization of SF-1,
      the modification inhibits the ability of SF-1 to activate target genes. Notably, 
      whereas SF-1 SUMOylation is independent of S203 phosphorylation and is unaffected
      by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) treatment, loss of SUMOylation leads to enhanced
      SF-1 phosphorylation at serine 203. Furthermore, preventing SF-1 SUMOylation
      increases the mRNA and protein levels of multiple steroidogenic enzyme genes.
      Analysis of the StAR promoter indicates that blockade of SF-1 SUMOylation leads
      to an increase in overall promoter occupancy but does not alter the oscillatory
      recruitment dynamics in response to ACTH. Notably, we find that CDK7 binds
      preferentially to the SUMOylation-deficient form of SF-1 and that CDK7 inhibition
      reduces phosphorylation of SF-1. Based on these observations, we propose a
      coordinated modification model in which inhibition of SF-1-mediated transcription
      by SUMOylation in adrenocortical cancer cells is mediated through reduced
      CDK7-induced phosphorylation of SF-1.

      differentiation.
PG  - 315-23
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00347-08 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian Cdk7, cyclin H, and Mat1 form the kinase submodule of transcription
      factor IIH (TFIIH) and have been considered ubiquitously expressed elements of
      the transcriptional machinery. Here we found that Mat1 and Cdk7 levels are
      undetectable in adipose tissues in vivo and downregulated during adipogenesis,
      where activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) 
      acts as a critical differentiation switch. Using both Mat1(-/-) mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts and Cdk7 knockdown approaches, we show that the Cdk7 complex is an
      inhibitor of adipogenesis and is required for inactivation of PPARgamma through
      the phosphorylation of PPARgamma-S112. The results demonstrate that the Cdk7
      submodule of TFIIH acts as a physiological roadblock to adipogenesis by
      inhibiting PPARgamma activity. The observation that components of TFIIH are
      absent from transcriptionally active adipose tissue prompts a reevaluation of the
      ubiquitous nature of basal transcription factors in mammalian tissues.

TI  - Oroxylin A induces G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest via inhibiting Cdk7-mediated
      expression of Cdc2/p34 in human gastric carcinoma BGC-823 cells.
PG  - 1459-63
LID - 10.1211/jpp/60.11.0006 [doi]
AB  - We reported previously that oroxylin A, a natural product isolated from
      Scutellariae Radix, was a potent apoptosis inducer of human hepatoma HepG2 cells.
      In this study, cell-cycle arrest of BGC-823 human gastric carcinoma cells caused 
      by oroxylin A has been investigated. Based on our
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay and flow 
      cytometric analysis, treatment of BGC-823 cells with growth suppressive
      concentrations of oroxylin A caused an irreversible arrest in the G2/M phase of
      the cell cycle. Western blot analysis demonstrated that oroxylin A-induced
      cell-cycle arrest in BGC-823 cells was associated with a significant decrease in 
      cdc2/p34, cyclin B1 and cyclin A expression. In addition, oroxylin A-treated
      cells decreased the expression of Cdk7, which was responsible for the low
      expression of M phase promoting factor (cyclin B1/Cdc2). The results suggested
      that oroxylin A induced G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest via inhibiting Cdk7-mediated
      expression of Cdc2/p34 in human gastric carcinoma BGC-823 cells.

PG  - 300-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and clinical significance of cyclin H
      and cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) in human hemangiomas. METHODS:
      Immunohistochemistry technique was used to measure the expression of cyclin H and
      CDK7 proteins in proliferative, involuting hemangiomas and normal skin tissues.
      Immunohistochemical technique for factor VIII-related antigen was used to prove
      that the cells which expressed cyclin H and CDK7 were endothelial cells. Average 
      optical density and positive area of the expression of cyclin H and CDK7 proteins
      in proliferative, involuting hemangiomas and normal skin tissues were measured by
      image analysis (HPIAS-1000). RESULTS: The expression of cyclin H and CDK7 protein
      in proliferating hemangiomas was significantly higher than that in involuting
      hemangiomas and normal skin tissues (P < 0.01). But no significant difference was
      found in the expression of cyclin H and CDK7 protein between involuting
      hemangiomas and normal skin tissues (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: cyclin H and CDK7
      may play an important role in the generation and development of human
      hemangiomas.

AB  - Escape from the proper control of the cell cycle by up-regulation of cyclins or
      aberrant activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) as well as by inactivation
      of cellular inhibitors of CDKs (CKI) leads to malignant transformation. Loss of
      cellular CKIs in cancers provided a rationale for development of pharmacological 
      inhibitors of CDKs. Recently synthesized CKIs, e.g., purine derivatives such as
      olomoucine (OLO) and roscovitine (ROSC) are non-genotoxic and exhibit increased
      selectivity towards CDK2 and CDK7/9. Interestingly, both drugs induce additional 
      effects. Recently, a new, unexpected action of OLO on normal human cells was
      observed. OLO strongly up-regulates CLIMP-63, a 65 kD protein that mediates the
      anchoring of the ER to microtubules. Moreover, ROSC induces in human MCF-7 cells 
      phosphorylation of p53 protein at Ser-46 which in turn initiates
      caspase-independent apoptosis. In the present contribution we raised the question
      whether both CKIs would be able to block cell cycle progression and to reactivate
      p53 protein in human HPV-positive HeLa cervix carcinoma cells. We also addressed 
      the question whether exponentially growing cancer cells are more susceptible to
      the inhibitory action of CKIs than normal cells. Our results show that HeLa cells
      are much more sensitive to ROSC than normal fibroblasts. ROSC induces G(2) arrest
      and apoptosis in HeLa cells. It also reactivates and stabilizes wt p53 protein.
      The increase of p53 protein coincides with down-regulation of E6 oncoprotein.
      Thus, the biological action of substituted purines is not restricted to the
      inhibition of CDKs and open new perspectives for their therapeutic applications.

TI  - Role of cdk9 in the optimization of expression of the genes regulated by ICP22 of
      herpes simplex virus 1.
PG  - 10591-9
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01242-08 [doi]
AB  - ICP22 is a multifunctional herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) regulatory protein that
      regulates the accumulation of a subset of late (gamma(2)) proteins exemplified by
      U(L)38, U(L)41, and U(S)11. ICP22 binds the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) but 
      not cdk7, and this complex in conjunction with viral protein kinases
      phosphorylates the carboxyl terminus of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in vitro. The 
      primary function of cdk9 and its partners, the cyclin T variants, is in the
      elongation of RNA transcripts, although functions related to the initiation and
      processing of transcripts have also been reported. We report two series of
      experiments designed to probe the role of cdk9 in infected cells. In the first,
      infected cells were treated with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole
      (DRB), a specific inhibitor of cdk9. In cells treated with DRB, the major effect 
      was in the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins regulated by ICP22. The
      accumulation of alpha, beta, or gamma proteins not regulated by ICP22 was not
      affected by the drug. The results obtained with DRB were duplicated in cells
      transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting cdk9 mRNAs.
      Interestingly, DRB and siRNA reduced the levels of ICP22 but not those of other
      alpha gene products. In addition, cdk9 and ICP22 appeared to colocalize with RNA 
      Pol II in wild-type-virus-infected cells but not in DeltaU(L)13-infected cells.
      We conclude that cdk9 plays a critical role in the optimization of expression of 
      genes regulated by ICP22 and that one function of cdk9 in HSV-1-infected cells
      may be to bring ICP22 into the RNA Pol II transcriptional complex.

AB  - In order to understand the transcriptional mechanism that underlies cell
      protection to stress, we evaluated the role of CLP-1, a known inhibitor of the
      transcription elongation complex (pTEFb), in CLP-1 +/- mice hearts. Using the
      isolated heart model, we observed that the CLP-1 +/- hearts, when subjected to
      ischaemic stress and evaluated by haemodynamic measurements, exhibit significant 
      cardioprotection. CLP-1 remains associated with the pTEFb complex in the
      heterozygous hearts, where as it is released in the wild-type hearts suggesting
      the involvement of pTEFb regulation in cell protection. There was a decrease in
      Cdk7 and Cdk9 kinase activity and consequently in phosphorylation of serine-5 and
      serine-2 of Pol II CTD in CLP-1 +/- hearts. However, the levels of mitochondrial 
      proteins, PGC-1alpha and HIF-1alpha, which enhance mitochondrial activity and are
      implicated in cell survival, were increased in CLP-1 +/- hearts subjected to
      ischaemic stress compared to that in wild-type CLP-1 +/- hearts treated
      identically. There was also an increase in the expression of pyruvate
      dehydrogenase kinase (PDK-1), which facilitates cell adaptation to hypoxic
      stress. Taken together, our data suggest that regulation of the CLP-1 levels is
      critical to cellular adaptation of the survival program that protects
      cardiomyocytes against stress due collectively to a decrease in RNA Pol II
      phosphorylation but an increase in expression of target proteins that regulate
      mitochondrial function and metabolic adaptation to stress.

TI  - Hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in response to topoisomerase I cleavage
      complexes and its association with transcription- and BRCA1-dependent degradation
      of topoisomerase I.
PG  - 540-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.06.028 [doi]
AB  - The progression of RNA polymerase II can be blocked by lesions on the DNA
      template. In this study, we focused on the modifications of the largest subunit
      of RNA polymerase II, Rpb1, in response to stabilized topoisomerase I (Top1)-DNA 
      cleavage complexes. In addition to DNA modifications (base damages and strand
      breaks), Top1 cleavage complexes can be trapped by camptothecin (CPT) and its
      derivatives used in cancer treatment. We found that, within a few minutes, CPT
      produces the complete hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 in both primary and
      transformed cancer cells. Hyperphosphorylation is rapidly reversible following
      CPT removal. Hyperphosphorylation occurs selectively on the serine 5 residue of
      the conserved heptapeptide repeats in the Rpb1 carboxy-terminal domain and is
      mediated principally by the transcription factor IIH-associated cyclin-dependent 
      kinase Cdk7. Hyperphosphorylated Rpb1 is not primarily targeted for proteosomal
      degradation and instead is subjected to cycles of phosphorylation and
      dephosphorylation as long as Top1 cleavage complexes are trapped by CPT. Finally,
      we show that transcription-induced degradation of Top1 is Brca1 dependent,
      suggesting a role for Brca1 in the repair or removal of transcription-blocking
      Top1-DNA cleavage complexes.

TI  - Somatic hypermutation signature in B-cell low-grade lymphomas.
PG  - 1186-94
LID - 10.3324/haematol.12999 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation is a biologically relevant 
      and clinically useful prognostic factor in different types of low-grade B-cell
      lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and
      splenic marginal zone lymphoma. DESIGN AND METHODS: With the aim of identifying
      surrogate markers of somatic hypermutation, a combined investigation of IgV(H)
      mutational status and expression profiles of 93 samples from patients with small 
      B-cell lymphoma was performed. RESULTS: The analysis identified an somatic
      hypermutation signature of genes involved in the regulation of gene
      transcription, DNA repair and replication, and chromosome maintenance. Eight of
      these genes were subjected to protein analysis using tissue microarrays, for a
      set of 118 cases. We found a clear link between RAD51C and CDK7 protein
      expression and somatic hypermutation status, in that positive expression of
      either marker was significantly associated with a mutated status (p<0.003). We
      also found that positive expression of TFDP1 and POLA was significantly
      associated with ongoing somatic hypermutation (p<0.001). To assess the potential 
      clinical applicability of these somatic hypermutation markers, we studied a
      series of cases of mantle cell lymphoma included in a tissue microarray. The
      expression of RCC1 and CDK7, separately and together, was found to be
      significantly associated with longer overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: An somatic
      hypermutation signature has been identified for different types of small B-cell
      lymphoma. This has a potential mechanistic and diagnostic value.

TI  - The CDK-activating kinase (CAK) Csk1 is required for normal levels of homologous 
      recombination and resistance to DNA damage in fission yeast.
PG  - e1492
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0001492 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) perform essential roles in cell
      division and gene expression in all eukaryotes. The requirement for an upstream
      CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is also universally conserved, but the fission yeast 
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe appears to be unique in having two CAKs with both
      overlapping and specialized functions that can be dissected genetically. The Mcs6
      complex--orthologous to metazoan Cdk7/cyclin H/Mat1--activates the cell-cycle
      CDK, Cdk1, but its non-redundant essential function appears to be in regulation
      of gene expression, as part of transcription factor TFIIH. The other CAK is Csk1,
      an ortholog of budding yeast Cak1, which activates all three essential CDKs in S.
      pombe--Cdk1, Mcs6 and Cdk9, the catalytic subunit of positive transcription
      elongation factor b (P-TEFb)--but is not itself essential. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: Cells lacking csk1(+) are viable but hypersensitive to agents that
      damage DNA or block replication. Csk1 is required for normal levels of homologous
      recombination (HR), and interacts genetically with components of the HR pathway. 
      Tests of damage sensitivity in csk1, mcs6 and cdk9 mutants indicate that Csk1
      acts pleiotropically, through Cdk9 and at least one other target (but not through
      Mcs6) to preserve genomic integrity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The two CAKs in
      fission yeast, which differ with respect to their substrate range and preferences
      for monomeric CDKs versus CDK/cyclin complexes as substrates, also support
      different functions of the CDK network in vivo. Csk1 plays a non-redundant role
      in safeguarding genomic integrity. We propose that specialized activation
      pathways dependent on different CAKs might insulate CDK functions important in
      DNA damage responses from those capable of triggering mitosis.

TI  - [Screening, cloning and identification of the human endometrial carcinoma-related
      genes].
PG  - 584-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen, clone and identify the cDNA fragments of human endometrial 
      carcinoma-related genes,and explore the molecular mechanism of endometrial
      carcinogenesis. METHODS: Pure endometrial glandular epithelial cells and
      endometrial carcinoma cells were obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM).
      RNA from these cells was isolated, and differentially expressed gene fragments
      that were specialy relevant to endometrial carcingenesis were identified by using
      fluorescence differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
      (FDD-PCR). The selected fragments were cloned, sequenced and verified by reverse 
      Northern blot analysis, and positive fragments were BLAST analysed and compared
      with those in Genbank. RESULTS: 38 differential fragments were isolated, 3 of
      which were expressed more abundantly in normal endometrium and 35 were highly
      expressed in endometrial carcinoma. 10 fragments were recoverd, cloned and
      sequenced, confirmed by reverse Northern blot analysis, among which 6 fragments
      were positive. BLAST analysis showed that T1.1 was homologous to cyclin-dependent
      protein kinase 7 (CDK7, 99%); L1.9 was homologous to protein phosphatase 1
      regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 12A (PPP1R12A, 99%); L1.21 and L1.22 were
      homologous to cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes 1 (CREG, 100%); L1.25
      and L1.26 were homologous to solute carrier family 39 (zinc transporter) member
      10 (SLC39A10, >98%). CONCLUSION: Gene fragments related to endometrial carcinoma 
      have been obtained by applying LCM and FDD-PCR. To our knowledge it is the first 
      time that the correlation between CDK7, PPP1R12A, CREG, SLC39A10 and endometrial 
      carcinoma is discovered at mRNA level, and their role in molecular mechanism of
      cancinogenesis is discussed. CDK7, CREG, SLC39A10 as new candidate oncogene and
      PPP1R12A as new candidate anti-oncogene are worthy of being further investigated 
      in the future.

TI  - TFIIH controls developmentally-regulated cell cycle progression as a holocomplex.
PG  - 1289-300
AB  - Basal transcription factor, TFIIH, is a multifunctional complex that carries out 
      not only transcription but also DNA repair and cell cycle control. TFIIH is
      composed of two sub-complexes: core TFIIH and Cdk-activating kinase (CAK). In
      vitro studies suggest that CAK is sufficient for cell cycle regulation, whereas
      core TFIIH is required for DNA repair. However, the TFIIH complexes that perform 
      these functions in vivo have yet to be identified. Here, we perform an in vivo
      dissection of TFIIH activity by characterizing mutations in a core subunit p52 in
      Drosophila. p52 mutants are hypersensitive to UV, suggesting a defect in DNA
      repair. Nonetheless, mutant cells are able to divide and express a variety of
      differentiation markers. Although p52 is not essential for cell cycle progression
      itself, p52 mutant cells in the eye imaginal disc are unable to synchronize their
      cell cycles and remain arrested at G1. Similar cell cycle phenotypes are observed
      in mutations in another core subunit XPB and a CAK-component CDK7, suggesting
      that defects in core TFIIH affect the G1/S transition through modification of CAK
      activity. We propose that during development the function of TFIIH as a cell
      cycle regulator is carried out by holo-TFIIH.

TI  - Inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinases at the beginning of human
      cytomegalovirus infection specifically alters the levels and localization of the 
      RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain kinases cdk9 and cdk7 at the viral
      transcriptosome.
PG  - 394-407
AB  - We previously reported that defined components of the host transcription
      machinery are recruited to human cytomegalovirus immediate-early (IE)
      transcription sites, including cdk9 and cdk7 (S. Tamrakar, A. J. Kapasi, and D.
      H. Spector, J. Virol. 79:15477-15493, 2005). In this report, we further document 
      the complexity of this site, referred to as the transcriptosome, through
      identification of additional resident proteins, including viral UL69 and cellular
      cyclin T1, Brd4, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and HDAC2. To examine the role of
      cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) in the establishment of this site, we used
      roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cdk1, cdk2, cdk7, and cdk9, that alters
      processing of viral IE transcripts and inhibits expression of viral early genes. 
      In the presence of roscovitine, IE2, cyclin T1, Brd4, HDAC1, and HDAC2 accumulate
      at the transcriptosome. However, accumulation of cdk9 and cdk7 was specifically
      inhibited. Roscovitine treatment also resulted in decreased levels of cdk9 and
      cdk7 RNA. There was a corresponding reduction in cdk9 protein but only a modest
      decrease in cdk7 protein. However, overexpression of cdk9 does not compensate for
      the effects of roscovitine on cdk9 localization or viral gene expression.
      Delaying the addition of roscovitine until 8 h postinfection prevented all of the
      observed effects of the cdk inhibitor. These data suggest that IE2 and multiple
      cellular factors needed for viral RNA synthesis accumulate within the first 8 h
      at the viral transcriptosome and that functional cdk activity is required for the
      specific recruitment of cdk7 and cdk9 during this time interval.

TI  - Phosphorylation of steroidogenic factor 1 is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 
      7.
PG  - 91-104
AB  - The nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) is critical for development and
      function of steroidogenic tissues. Posttranslational modifications are known to
      influence the transcriptional capacity of SF1, and it was previously demonstrated
      that serine 203 is phosphorylated. In this paper we report that serine 203 is
      phosphorylated by a cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7)-mediated process. As part of
      the CDK-activating kinase complex, CDK7 is a component of the basal transcription
      factor TFIIH, and phosphorylation of SF1 as well as SF1-dependent transcription
      was clearly reduced in cells carrying a mutation that renders the CDK-activating 
      kinase complex unable to interact with the TFIIH core. Coimmunoprecipitation
      analyses revealed that SF1 and CDK7 reside in the same complex, and kinase assays
      demonstrated that immunoprecipitated CDK7 and purified TFIIH phosphorylate SF1 in
      vitro. The CDK inhibitor roscovitine blocked phosphorylation of SF1, and an
      inactive form of CDK7 repressed the phosphorylation level and the transactivation
      capacity of SF1. Structural studies have identified phosphoinositides as
      potential ligands for SF1. Interestingly, we found that mutations designed to
      block phospholipid binding dramatically decreased the level of SF1
      phosphorylation. Together our results suggest a connection between ligand
      occupation and phosphorylation and association with the basic transcriptional
      machinery, indicating an intricate regulation of SF1 transactivation.

TI  - Acetylation-induced transcription is required for active DNA demethylation in
      methylation-silenced genes.
PG  - 7462-74
AB  - A hallmark of vertebrate genes is that actively transcribed genes are
      hypomethylated in critical regulatory sequences. However, the mechanisms that
      link gene transcription and DNA hypomethylation are unclear. Using a trichostatin
      A (TSA)-induced replication-independent demethylation assay with HEK 293 cells,
      we show that RNA transcription is required for DNA demethylation. Histone
      acetylation precedes but is not sufficient to trigger DNA demethylation.
      Following histone acetylation, RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) interacts with the
      methylated promoter. Inhibition of RNAP II transcription with actinomycin D,
      alpha-amanitin, or CDK7-specific small interfering RNA inhibits DNA
      demethylation. H3 trimethyl lysine 4 methylation, a marker of actively
      transcribed genes, was associated with the cytomegalovirus promoter only after
      demethylation. TSA-induced demethylation of the endogenous cancer testis gene
      GAGE follows a similar sequence of events and is dependent on RNA transcription
      as well. These data suggest that DNA demethylation follows rather than precedes
      early transcription and point towards a novel function for DNA demethylation as a
      memory of actively transcribed genes.

TI  - Polymorphisms of CAK genes and risk for lung cancer: a case-control study in
      Chinese population.
PG  - 171-83
AB  - The incidence of lung cancer has been increasing over recent decades. Previous
      studies show that polymorphisms of the genes involved in carcinogen-detoxication,
      DNA repair and cell cycle control compose of the risk factors for lung cancer.
      Recent observations reveal that the components of CAK: Cdk7, MAT1 and cyclin H,
      may play important roles in cell cycle control, transcriptional control, and DNA 
      repairing process, all of which are important in carcinogenesis. To test whether 
      the genetic variants of CAK genes modify the risk of lung cancer, we compared the
      manifestation of 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the haplotypes of 
      Cdk7, MAT1 and cyclin H between 500 patients with lung cancer and 517 healthy
      controls. Our results indicated that the genotype frequency of MAT1 79023A/G (p =
      0.042) and MAT1 85693C/T (p = 0.005) of cases significantly differed from those
      of the controls. Further analyses revealed that cyclin H 11817C/T, MAT1 12199A/G,
      MAT1 70650A/G, MAT1 79023A/G and MAT1 85693C/T significantly influenced the
      susceptibility of lung cancer in a dominant genetic model while cyclin H 12128A/T
      and MAT1 42172A/G did in a recessive model. Strongest association between cyclin 
      H alleles and lung cancer patients was found in the non-smoke subpopulation. The 
      haplotype 'TAC' (p = 0.007) increased and the haplotype 'TTC' (p = 0.043)
      decreased the risk of lung cancer. The potential gene-gene and gene-environmental
      interactions on lung cancer risk was evaluated using MDR software. A significant 
      interaction between the three CAK component genes was identified and the
      combination of smoking status and genetic factors barely increased the accuracy. 
      Our results suggested that genetic variants in CAK genes, Cdk7, cyclin H, MAT1,
      might modulate the risk of lung cancer in a gene-gene interaction mode, which
      consist to the biochemical interaction of corresponding proteins.

TI  - In silico three-dimensional pharmacophores for aiding the discovery of the Pfmrk 
      (Plasmodium cyclin-dependent protein kinases) specific inhibitors for the
      therapeutic treatment of malaria.
PG  - 1115-27
LID - 10.1517/17460441.2.8.1115 [doi]
AB  - The resurgence of malaria and lack of effective antimalarial drugs affect
      millions of people worldwide every year, causing several million deaths. With the
      emergence of structure-based drug design methodologies, a major thrust in drug
      discovery efforts has shifted towards targeting specific proteins in parasites
      that are involved in their metabolic pathways. Although cyclin-dependent kinases 
      (CDKs), due to their direct role in cell cycle regulations, have been targeted
      for the development of cancer therapeutics, CDKs for Plasmodium falciparum have
      only been recently identified to be attractive for the discovery of
      antimalarials. One of the plasmodium CDK targets is Pfmrk. Being a putative
      homolog of Cdk7 and, thus, having the possibility of dual functions, both in cell
      cycle control and gene expression within the parasite, pfrmk has become an
      interesting antimalarial chemotherapeutic target. This review discusses how in
      silico methodologies, without the knowledge of the X-ray crystallographic
      structure of Pfmrk, particularly based on the development of pharmacophores on
      known inhibitors can aid the discovery and design of Pfmrk-specific inhibitors
      through virtual screening of compound databases and provides insights into the
      understanding of the mechanism of binding in the active site of this enzyme.

TI  - A combined pathway to simulate CDK-dependent phosphorylation and ARF-dependent
      stabilization for p53 transcriptional activity.
PG  - 112-23
AB  - The protein p53 is phosphorylated by a member of protein kinases such as CDK7,
      and stabilized by the protein ARF. The phosphorylation and stabilization of p53
      is believed to enhance its transcriptional activity and act simultaneously.
      Biological pathways composed of experts knowledge obtained from the literature
      are including these activation mechanisms. However, the map of biological
      pathways does not reflect the combination effect of phosphorylation and
      stabilization. We have conducted some simulations of biological pathways with
      hybrid functional Petri net (HFPN) after careful reading of papers. In this
      paper, we constructed the HFPN based biological pathway of CDK-dependent
      phosphorylation pathway and combine with ARF-dependent pathway described
      previously, to observe the effect of the phosphorylation on the stabilization
      with simulation-based validation.

TI  - Roles of Arabidopsis cyclin-dependent kinase C complexes in cauliflower mosaic
      virus infection, plant growth, and development.
PG  - 1388-402
AB  - The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II is phosphorylated during the
      transcription cycle by three cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs): CDK7, CDK8, and
      CDK9. CDK9 and its interacting cyclin T partners belong to the positive
      transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complexes, which phosphorylate the CTD
      to promote transcription elongation. We report that Arabidopsis thaliana
      CDK9-like proteins, CDKC;1 and CDKC;2, and their interacting cyclin T partners,
      CYCT1;4 and CYCT1;5, play important roles in infection with Cauliflower mosaic
      virus (CaMV). cdkc;2 and cyct1;5 knockout mutants are highly resistant and cdkc;2
      cyct1;5 double mutants are extremely resistant to CaMV. The mutants respond
      normally to other types of plant viruses that do not replicate by reverse
      transcription. Expression of a reporter gene driven by the CaMV 35S promoter is
      markedly reduced in the cdkc;2 and cyct1;5 mutants, indicating that the kinase
      complexes are important for transcription from the viral promoter. Loss of
      function of CDKC;1/CDKC;2 or CYCT1;4/CYCT1;5 results in complete resistance to
      CaMV as well as altered leaf and flower growth, trichome development, and delayed
      flowering. These results establish Arabidopsis CDKC kinase complexes as important
      host targets of CaMV for transcriptional activation of viral genes and critical
      regulators of plant growth and development.

TI  - Protein kinases and the proteasome join in the combinatorial control of
      transcription by nuclear retinoic acid receptors.
PG  - 302-9
AB  - Nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are transcriptional transregulators that
      control the expression of specific subsets of genes in a ligand-dependent manner.
      The basic mechanism for switching on gene transcription by agonist-liganded RARs 
      involves their binding at specific response elements located in target genes. It 
      also involves interactions with coregulatory protein complexes, the assembly of
      which is directed by the C-terminal ligand-binding domain of RARs. In addition to
      this scenario, several recent studies highlighted a fundamental role for the
      N-terminal domain in the transcriptional activity of RARs, following
      phosphorylation by the CDK7 kinase of the general transcription factor TFIIH and 
      by p38MAPK. It has also emerged that the ubiquitin-proteasome system has a key
      role in RAR-mediated transcription. Here, we review new insights into how
      N-terminal domain and the proteasome pathway can influence the dynamics of RAR
      transcriptional activity.

TI  - Application of laser capture microdissection and differential display technique
      for screening of pathogenic genes involved in endometrial carcinoma.
PG  - 1224-30
AB  - The objective is to eliminate the interference from other cell types; gene
      fragments involved in endometrial carcinoma (EC) are screened and cloned. Human
      normal endometrial glandular epithelia and EC cells were harvested with laser
      capture microdissection (LCM). The purification and concentration of minimal RNA 
      were used to screen differential expressed gene fragments involved in EC by
      fluoro differential display polymerase chain reaction (FDD-PCR). The differential
      gene fragments were cloned, sequenced, and then identified by reverse Northern
      blot hybridization. Positive fragments were analyzed with basic local alignment
      search tool (BLAST). Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) expressions in EC and
      normal endometrial tissue were tested by immunohistochemical staining. Of 38
      differential bands, 3 bands were of high expression in normal endometrium and 35 
      in EC. Six positive differential gene fragments were obtained and BLAST analysis 
      for them suggested that L1.1 was homologous (99% identical) to the CDK7; L1.9 had
      a 99% homology with protein phosphatase 1 regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 12 A
      (PPP1R12A); L1.21 and L1.22 showed a 100% homology with cellular repressor of
      E1A-stimulated genes 1 (CREG); and L1.25 and L1.26 indicated more than 98%
      homology with solute carrier family 39 (zinc transporter), member 10 (SLC39A10). 
      Immunohistochemistry revealed that CDK7 expression was higher in EC than in
      normal endometrium. We conclude that pathogenic genes involved in EC are obtained
      with LCM and FDD-PCR. It has been first found that CDK7, PPP1R12A, CREG, and
      SLC39A10 are correlative with EC from gene level. CDK7 is strongly associated
      with EC and can be used as potential molecular marker of EC for further studies.

TI  - Glucose regulation of CDK7, a putative thiol related gene, in experimental
      diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 237-44
AB  - We previously described the identification of the 3'end of an unknown gene CDK7
      using differential display which appeared to be up-regulated in diabetic kidneys 
      [R.A. Page, C.A. Morris, J.D. Williams, C.J. von Ruhland, A.N. Malik, Isolation
      of diabetes-associated kidney genes using differential display, Biochem. Biophys.
      Res. Commun. 232 (1997) 49-53]. Here we show that CDK7 is a putative thiol
      related gene which is regulated by glucose in human and rat renal cells. CDK7
      mRNA increased by >threefold in cultured human mesangial cells grown in high
      glucose for 4 days. In the kidneys of the GK rat, a model of type II diabetes,
      CDK7 showed a steady age-related increase in mRNA, increasing to >sixfold in 40
      week GK rats compared to normoglycemic age-matched Wistar rat kidneys, this
      increase correlates with progressive hyperglycemia. CDK7 mRNA is widely
      expressed, showing particularly high levels of expression in rat and human liver,
      and encodes a putative 338 amino acids highly conserved peptide with several
      conserved domains, including a cys-pro-arg-cys domain conserved in 15 diverse
      species which is similar to the catalytic centre of thioredoxin, suggesting a
      role in oxidative stress.

TI  - Chemical inhibition of the TFIIH-associated kinase Cdk7/Kin28 does not impair
      global mRNA synthesis.
PG  - 5812-7
AB  - The process of gene transcription requires the recruitment of a
      hypophosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to a gene promoter. The
      TFIIH-associated kinase Cdk7/Kin28 hyperphosphorylates the promoter-bound
      polymerase; this event is thought to play a crucial role in transcription
      initiation and promoter clearance. Studies using temperature-sensitive mutants of
      Kin28 have provided the most compelling evidence for an essential role of its
      kinase activity in global mRNA synthesis. In contrast, using a small molecule
      inhibitor that specifically inhibits Kin28 in vivo, we find that the kinase
      activity is not essential for global transcription. Unlike the
      temperature-sensitive alleles, the small-molecule inhibitor does not perturb
      protein-protein interactions nor does it provoke the disassociation of TFIIH from
      gene promoters. These results lead us to conclude that other functions of TFIIH, 
      rather than the kinase activity, are critical for global gene transcription.

TI  - Requirements for Cdk7 in the assembly of Cdk1/cyclin B and activation of Cdk2
      revealed by chemical genetics in human cells.
PG  - 839-50
AB  - Cell division is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In metazoans, S
      phase onset coincides with activation of Cdk2, whereas Cdk1 triggers mitosis.
      Both Cdk1 and -2 require cyclin binding and T loop phosphorylation for full
      activity. The only known CDK-activating kinase (CAK) in metazoans is Cdk7, which 
      is also part of the transcription machinery. To test the requirements for Cdk7 in
      vivo, we replaced wild-type Cdk7 with a version sensitive to bulky ATP analogs in
      human cancer cells. Selective inhibition of Cdk7 in G1 prevents activation (but
      not formation) of Cdk2/cyclin complexes and delays S phase. Inhibiting Cdk7 in G2
      blocks entry to mitosis and disrupts Cdk1/cyclin B complex assembly, indicating
      that the two steps of Cdk1 activation-cyclin binding and T loop
      phosphorylation-are mutually dependent. Therefore, by combining chemical genetics
      and homologous gene replacement in somatic cells, we reveal different modes of
      CDK activation by Cdk7 at two distinct execution points in the cell cycle.

TI  - Mechanisms involved in ceramide-induced cell cycle arrest in human
      hepatocarcinoma cells.
PG  - 1129-34
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of ceramide on the cell cycle in human
      hepatocarcinoma Bel7402 cells. Possible molecular mechanisms were explored.
      METHODS: [3- (4, 5)-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) 
      assay, plasmid transfection, reporter assay, FACS and Western blotting analyses
      were employed to investigate the effect and the related molecular mechanisms of
      C2-ceramide on the cell cycle of Bel7402 cells. RESULTS: C2-ceramide was found to
      inhibit the growth of Bel7402 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest. During the
      process, the expression of p21 protein increased, while that of cyclinD1,
      phospho-ERK1/2 and c-myc decreased. Furthermore, the level of CDK7 was
      downregulated, while the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma was upregulated.
      Addition of GW9662, which is a PPARgamma specific antagonist, could reserve the
      modulation action on CDK7. CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that
      cell cycle arrest induced by C2-ceramide may be mediated via accumulation of p21 
      and reduction of cyclinD1 and CDK7, at least partly, through PPARgamma
      activation. The ERK signaling pathway was involved in this process.

TI  - Recognition of Cdk2 by Cdk7.
PG  - 1048-59
AB  - Cdk7, a member of the cyclin dependent protein kinase family, regulates the
      activities of other Cdks through phosphorylation on their activation segment, and
      hence contributes to control of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Cdk7 is itself
      phosphorylated on the activation segment. Cdk7 phosphorylates Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4,
      and Cdk6, but only Cdk1 and Cdk2 can phosphorylate Cdk7 and none of them is able 
      to auto-phosphorylate. The activation segments of the Cdks are very similar in
      sequence. Their specificity does not appear to be dictated by the sequences
      surrounding the phosphorylation sites but by structural determinants at remote
      sites. Through mutagenesis studies, we have identified regions in Cdk2
      responsible for its interaction with Cdk7. A model has been built that explains
      the molecular basis for the specificity observed in Cdk recognition. The two
      kinases are arranged in a quasi-symmetric head-to-tail arrangement in which the
      N-terminal lobe from one kinase docks against the C-terminal lobe from the other 
      kinase, and the activation segments are within reach of the opposite catalytic
      sites. Further experiments demonstrate that cyclin A hydrophobic pocket is not a 
      recruitment site for Cdk7.

TI  - Autocatalytic phosphorylation of CDK2 at the activating Thr160.
PG  - 843-52
AB  - Phosphorylation of a critical residue in the activation loop of many protein
      kinases is essential for enzymatic activity. The trimeric complex CDK7/cyclin
      H/Mat1 phosphorylates the cell cycle regulated cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK2 at
      Thr-160 in the activation segment in vitro. Whether CDK7/cyclin H is the in vivo 
      CDK2 activating kinase (CAK), or the sole CAK for CDK2 remains elusive. Here we
      show that monomeric human CDK2 purified from bacteria is phosphorylated at
      Thr-160. CDK2 expressed and purified from bacteria exhibited kinase activity
      against histone H1, which was stimulated by cyclin E or A expressed and purified 
      from bacteria. The kinase activity was dependent on both the catalytic activity
      of CDK2 and Thr-160 phosphorylation since it was abolished when CDK2 was mutated 
      at Lys33 in the ATP binding site (K33R) or Thr160 (T160A) or when treated with
      lambda phosphatase. Mass spectrometry based phosphopeptide mapping confirmed the 
      phosphorylation of bacterial CDK2 on Thr160. Consistent with a role of CDK2 in
      auto-activation, inhibition of CDK2 in human cells either by pharmacological
      inhibition of CDK2 or by the coexpression of the CDK2 inhibitors p21 or p27,
      inhibited CDK2 Thr-160 phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that CDK2 is
      capable of autophosphorylation at Thr160.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor seliciclib shows in vitro activity in diffuse
      large B-cell lymphomas.
PG  - 158-67
AB  - Despite recent improvements in treatment, a significant fraction of patients with
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) still fail therapy. Therefore, new
      therapeutic modalities are needed to advance the cure rate. Seliciclib (CYC202,
      R-roscovitine) is a purine analog developed as an inhibitor of CDK2/cyclin E
      CDK7/cyclin H and CDK9/cyclin T. Seliciclib has been shown to be active in B-cell
      neoplasms, such as mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in
      multiple myeloma in vitro. The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro
      activity of seliciclib in DLBCL. The anti-proliferative activity of seliciclib
      was tested in nine human DLBCL cell lines and six DLBCL primary cell cultures.
      The effects of seliciclib on the cell cycle and on apoptosis, as well as on
      transcription-related proteins were assessed. The cell viability of all DLBCL
      cell lines and primary cells was reduced by seliciclib treatment. The IC50 for
      the cell lines ranged from 13 - 36 microm. The effect of seliciclib was
      independent of the genetic aberrations characterizing the cell lines. After
      seliciclib exposure cells accumulated in G2/M or in G1 phase, with most of the
      cells showing signs of apoptosis. Despite the clear cytotoxic effect and
      induction of apoptosis, this study could not identify a unique mechanism of
      action. The in vitro data suggest that seliciclib is an active agent in DLBCL.
      Its efficacy is apparently independent of the underlying chromosomal
      translocations characteristic of DLBCL. The drug might represent a new
      therapeutic agent in this lymphoma sub-type.

TI  - Developmental expression of cyclin H and Cdk7 in zebrafish: the essential role of
      cyclin H during early embryo development.
PG  - 163-73
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) is the catalytic subunit of the metazoan
      Cdk-activating kinase (CAK). Activation of Cdk7 requires its association with a
      regulatory subunit, Cyclin H. Although the Cdk7/Cyclin H complex has been
      implicated in the regulation of RNA polymerase in several species, the precise
      function of their orthologs in zebrafish has not been fully elucidated. In this
      study, we isolated from zebrafish blastula embryos two cDNAs encoding the
      orthologs of human Cyclin H and Cdk7, and examined the role of Cdk7/Cyclin H in
      zebrafish embryogenesis. Sequence analysis showed that the zebrafish Cyclin H and
      Cdk7 cDNAs encode proteins with 65% and 86% identity to the respective human
      orthologs. RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses of their
      expression in unfertilized eggs, embryos and organs of adult fish suggested that 
      Cyclin H and Cdk7 messages are maternally loaded. Our data also showed that their
      transcripts were detected throughout development. Distribution of Cyclin H
      transcripts was found to be ubiquitous during early stages of development and
      become restricted to the anterior neural tube, brain, eyes, procreate tissues,
      liver and heart by 5 days post-fertilization. Expression of a dominant-negative
      form of Cyclin H delayed the onset of zygotic transcription in the early embryo, 
      resulting in apoptosis at 5 hours post-fertilization and leading to sever defects
      in tissues normally exhibiting high levels of Cyclin H expression. These results 
      implicate Cyclin H in the regulation of the transcriptional machinery during
      midblastula transition and suggest that it is an essential gene in early
      zebrafish larval development.

TI  - Menage-a-trois 1 is critical for the transcriptional function of PPARgamma
      coactivator 1.
PG  - 129-42
AB  - The Cdk7/cyclin H/menage-a-trois 1 (MAT1) heterotrimer has proposed functions in 
      transcription as the kinase component of basal transcription factor TFIIH and is 
      activated in adult hearts by Gq-, calcineurin-, and biomechanical
      stress-dependent pathways for hypertrophic growth. Using cardiac-specific Cre, we
      have ablated MAT1 in myocardium. Despite reduced Cdk7 activity, MAT1-deficient
      hearts grew normally, but fatal heart failure ensued at 6-8 weeks. By microarray 
      profiling, quantitative RT-PCR, and western blotting at 4 weeks, genes for energy
      metabolism were found to be suppressed selectively, including targets of
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1). Cardiac
      metabolic defects were substantiated in isolated perfused hearts and isolated
      mitochondria. In culture, deleting MAT1 with Cre disrupted PGC-1 function:
      PGC-1alpha failed to activate PGC-1-responsive promoters and nuclear receptors,
      GAL4-PGC-1alpha was functionally defective, and PGC-1beta was likewise deficient.
      PGC-1 bound to both MAT1 and Cdk7 in coprecipitation assays. Thus, we demonstrate
      a requirement for MAT1 in the operation of PGC-1 coactivators that control cell
      metabolism.

TI  - The Myc transactivation domain promotes global phosphorylation of the RNA
      polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain independently of direct DNA binding.
PG  - 2059-73
AB  - Myc is a transcription factor which is dependent on its DNA binding domain for
      transcriptional regulation of target genes. Here, we report the surprising
      finding that Myc mutants devoid of direct DNA binding activity and Myc target
      gene regulation can rescue a substantial fraction of the growth defect in
      myc(-/-) fibroblasts. Expression of the Myc transactivation domain alone induces 
      a transcription-independent elevation of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
      C-terminal domain (CTD) kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and CDK9 and a
      global increase in CTD phosphorylation. The Myc transactivation domain binds to
      the transcription initiation sites of these promoters and stimulates TFIIH
      binding in an MBII-dependent manner. Expression of the Myc transactivation domain
      increases CDK mRNA cap methylation, polysome loading, and the rate of
      translation. We find that some traditional Myc transcriptional target genes are
      also regulated by this Myc-driven translation mechanism. We propose that Myc
      transactivation domain-driven RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation has broad effects on
      both transcription and mRNA metabolism.

TI  - Improved tumor control through circadian clock induction by Seliciclib, a
      cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.
PG  - 10720-8
AB  - The circadian timing system and the cell division cycle are frequently
      deregulated in cancer. The therapeutic relevance of the reciprocal interactions
      between both biological rhythms was investigated using Seliciclib, a
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor (CDKI). Mice bearing Glasgow osteosarcoma
      received Seliciclib (300 mg/kg/d orally) or vehicle for 5 days at Zeitgeber time 
      (ZT) 3, 11, or 19. On day 6, tumor mRNA 24-hour expression patterns were
      determined for clock genes (Per2, Rev-erbalpha, and Bmal1) and clock-controlled
      cell cycle genes (c-Myc, Wee1, cyclin B1, and CDK1) with quantitative reverse
      transcription-PCR. Affinity chromatography on immobilized Seliciclib identified
      CDK1/CDK2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/ERK2, CDK7/CDK9, and 
      casein kinase CK1epsilon as Seliciclib targets, which respectively regulate cell 
      cycle, transcription, and circadian clock in Glasgow osteosarcoma. Seliciclib
      reduced tumor growth by 55% following dosing at ZT3 or ZT11 and by 35% at ZT19
      compared with controls (P < 0.001). Tolerability was also best at ZT3. Mean
      transcriptional activity of Rev-erbalpha, Per2, and Bmal1 was arrhythmic in the
      tumors of untreated mice. Seliciclib induced rhythmic clock gene expression
      patterns with physiologic phase relations only after ZT3 dosing. c-Myc and Wee1
      mRNAs displayed synchronous circadian rhythms in the tumors of control mice
      receiving vehicle only but not in those of mice given the drug. Seliciclib
      further enhanced Wee1 expression irrespective of dosing time, an effect that
      reinforced G(2)-M gating. Seliciclib also inhibited CK1epsilon, which determines 
      circadian period length. The coordination of clock gene expression patterns in
      tumor cells was associated with best antitumor activity of Seliciclib. The
      circadian clock and its upstream regulators represent relevant targets for CDKIs.

TI  - Estrogen receptor-alpha phosphorylated at Ser118 is present at the promoters of
      estrogen-regulated genes and is not altered due to HER-2 overexpression.
PG  - 10162-70
AB  - Detection of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha phosphorylated at Ser(118)
      (P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha) may be an indicator of an intact ligand-dependent ER-alpha 
      in breast tumors in vivo and may predict responsiveness to endocrine therapy. The
      current study addresses whether P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha is functionally involved in
      ER target gene transcription and if this is modulated by HER-2 overexpression.
      Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha was found
      associated with the promoters of several estrogen-regulated genes in MCF-7 breast
      cancer cells 30 minutes following estrogen treatment. Coactivators AIB1 and p300 
      were coimmunoprecipitated with P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha following estrogen treatment. 
      The overexpression of HER-2 protein in MCF-7 cells did not affect estrogen
      induction of phosphorylation of Ser(118) or its presence at the promoters of
      several estrogen-regulated genes. U0126, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, had no effect on P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha. The lack of 
      effect of HER-2 overexpression on P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha expression in cell models
      is supported by similar levels of expression of P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha in
      ER(+)/HER-2-overexpressing and ER(+)/HER-2(-) breast tumors in vivo. Using
      inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7),
      [(5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole and
      2-(R)-1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine], and IkappaB 
      kinase-alpha (IKK-alpha; BAY-11-7082), we show that IKK-alpha, but not Cdk7, is
      at least in part involved in estrogen-mediated phosphorylation at Ser(118) in
      MCF-7 cells. Our data provide direct evidence for a functional role of
      P-Ser(118)-ER-alpha in estrogen-regulated signaling and do not support the
      hypothesis that resistance of breast tumors to tamoxifen therapy involves ligand 
      independent activation of ER-alpha due to constitutive phosphorylation of
      Ser(118) by constitutive activation of MAPK pathway.

TI  - Gambogic acid-induced G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest via disturbing CDK7-mediated
      phosphorylation of CDC2/p34 in human gastric carcinoma BGC-823 cells.
PG  - 632-8
AB  - Molecular mechanisms of cell-cycle arrest caused by gambogic acid (GA), a natural
      product isolated from the gamboge resin of Garcinia hanburryi tree, have been
      investigated using BGC-823 human gastric carcinoma cells as a model. Based on our
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay and flow
      cytometric analysis, treatment of BGC-823 cells with growth suppressive
      concentrations of GA caused an irreversible arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the
      cell cycle. Western blot analysis demonstrated that GA-induced cell-cycle arrest 
      in BGC-823 cells was associated with a significant decrease in CDC2/p34
      synthesis, which led to the accumulation of phosphorylated-Tyr(15) (inactive)
      form of CDC2/p34. Real-time PCR, western blot and kinase activity assays revealed
      that GA-induced reduction of CDC2/p34 expression was mediated through the
      inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CDK7/cyclin H)
      activity. In addition, GA-treated cells were shown to have a low level of CDK7
      kinase-phosphorylated-Thr(161) CDC2/p34 (active). Taken together, our results
      suggested that the inhibited proliferation of GA-treated BGC-823 cells was
      associated with the decreased production of CDK7 mRNA and protein, which in turn,
      resulted in the reduction of CDK7 kinase activity. The reduced CDK7 kinase
      activity is responsible for the inactivation of CDC2/p34 kinase and the
      irreversible G(2)/M phase cell-cycle arrest of human gastric carcinoma BGC-823
      cells.

TI  - 3-(Indol-2-yl)indazoles as Chek1 kinase inhibitors: Optimization of potency and
      selectivity via substitution at C6.
PG  - 6049-53
AB  - The development of 3-(indol-2-yl)indazoles as inhibitors of Chek1 kinase is
      described. Introduction of amides and heteroaryl groups at the C6 position of the
      indazole ring system provided sufficient Chek1 potency and selectivity over Cdk7 
      to permit escape from DNA damage-induced arrest in a cellular assay. Enzyme
      potency against Chek1 was optimized by the incorporation of a hydroxymethyl
      triazole moiety in compound 21 (Chek1 IC(50)=0.30nM) that was shown by X-ray
      crystallography to displace one of three highly conserved water molecules in the 
      HI region of the ATP-binding cleft.

TI  - The fission yeast Rpb4 subunit of RNA polymerase II plays a specialized role in
      cell separation.
PG  - 545-54
AB  - RNA polymerase II is a complex of 12 subunits, Rpb1 to Rpb12, whose specific
      roles are only partly understood. Rpb4 is essential in mammals and fission yeast,
      but not in budding yeast. To learn more about the roles of Rpb4, we expressed the
      rpb4 gene under the control of regulatable promoters of different strength in
      fission yeast. We demonstrate that below a critical level of transcription, Rpb4 
      affects cellular growth proportional to its expression levels: cells expressing
      lower levels of rpb4 grew slower compared to cells expressing higher levels.
      Lowered rpb4 expression did not affect cell survival under several stress
      conditions, but it caused specific defects in cell separation similar to sep
      mutants. Microarray analysis revealed that lowered rpb4 expression causes a
      global reduction in gene expression, but the transcript levels of a distinct
      subset of genes were particularly responsive to changes in rpb4 expression. These
      genes show some overlap with those regulated by the Sep1-Ace2 transcriptional
      cascade required for cell separation. Most notably, the gene expression signature
      of cells with lowered rpb4 expression was highly similar to those of mcs6, pmh1, 
      sep10 and sep15 mutants. Mcs6 and Pmh1 encode orthologs of metazoan
      TFIIH-associated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (Cdk7-cyclin
      H-Mat1), while Sep10 and Sep15 encode mediator components. Our results suggest
      that Rpb4, along with some other general transcription factors, plays a
      specialized role in a transcriptional pathway that controls the cell
      cycle-regulated transcription of a specific subset of genes involved in cell
      division.

TI  - Replication-dependent DNA damage response triggered by roscovitine induces an
      uncoupling of DNA replication proteins.
PG  - 2153-9
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor roscovitine is under evaluation in
      clinical trials for its antiproliferative properties. Roscovitine arrests cell
      cycle progression in G(1) and in G(2) phase by inhibiting CDK2 and CDK1, and
      possibly CDK7 and CDK9. However, the effects of CDK2 inhibition in S-phase cells 
      have been not fully investigated. Here, we show that a short-term treatment with 
      roscovitine is sufficient to inhibit DNA synthesis, and to activate a DNA damage 
      checkpoint response, as indicated by phosphorylation of p53-Ser15, replication
      protein A, and histone H2AX. Analysis of DNA replication proteins loaded onto DNA
      during S phase showed that the amount of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
      (PCNA), a cofactor of DNA replication enzymes, was significantly reduced by
      roscovitine. In contrast, chromatin-bound levels of DNA polymerase delta, DNA
      ligase I and CDK2, were stabilized. Checkpoint inhibition with caffeine could
      rescue PCNA disassembly only partially, pointing to additional effects due to
      CDK2 inhibition and the presence of replication stress. These results suggest
      that in S-phase cells, roscovitine induces checkpoint-dependent and -independent 
      effects, leading to stabilization of replication forks and an uncoupling between 
      PCNA and PCNA-interacting proteins.

TI  - Identification of yin-yang regulators and a phosphorylation consensus for male
      germ cell-associated kinase (MAK)-related kinase.
PG  - 8639-54
AB  - MAK (male germ cell-associated protein kinase) and MRK/ICK (MAK-related
      kinase/intestinal cell kinase) are human homologs of Ime2p in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae and of Mde3 and Pit1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and are similar to
      human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      2 (ERK2). MAK and MRK require dual phosphorylation in a TDY motif catalyzed by an
      unidentified human threonine kinase and tyrosine autophosphorylation. Herein, we 
      establish that human CDK-related kinase CCRK (cell cycle-related kinase) is an
      activating T157 kinase for MRK, whereas active CDK7/cyclin H/MAT1 complexes
      phosphorylate CDK2 but not MRK. Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) interacts with MRK in
      a complex and dephosphorylates MRK at T157 in vitro and in situ. Thus, CCRK and
      PP5 are yin-yang regulators of T157 phosphorylation. To determine a substrate
      consensus, we screened a combinatorial peptide library with active MRK. MRK
      preferentially phosphorylates R-P-X-S/T-P sites, with the preference for arginine
      at position -3 (P-3) being more stringent than for prolines at P-2 and P+1. Using
      the consensus, we identified a putative phosphorylation site (RPLT(1080)S) for
      MRK in human Scythe, an antiapoptotic protein that interacts with MRK. MRK
      phosphorylates Scythe at T1080 in vitro as determined by site-directed
      mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, supporting the consensus and suggesting Scythe
      as a physiological substrate for MRK.

TI  - Recruitment of TFIIH to the HIV LTR is a rate-limiting step in the emergence of
      HIV from latency.
PG  - 3596-604
AB  - Latently infected cells rapidly initiate HIV transcription after exposure to
      signals that induce NF-kappaB. To investigate the role of TFIIH during HIV
      reactivation in vivo, we developed a population of Jurkat cells containing
      integrated, but transcriptionally silent, HIV proviruses. Surprisingly, the HIV
      promoter in unactivated Jurkat T cells is partially occupied and carries Mediator
      containing the CDK8 repressive module, TFIID and RNAP II that is
      hypophosphorylated and confined to the promoter region. Significantly, the
      promoter is devoid of TFIIH. Upon stimulation of the cells by TNF-alpha,
      NF-kappaB and TFIIH are rapidly recruited to the promoter together with
      additional Mediator and RNAP II, but CDK8 is lost. Detailed time courses show
      that the levels of TFIIH at the promoter fluctuate in parallel with NF-kappaB
      recruitment to the promoter. Similarly, recombinant p65 activates HIV
      transcription in vitro and stimulates phosphorylation of the RNAP II CTD by the
      CDK7 kinase module of TFIIH. We conclude that the recruitment and activation of
      TFIIH represents a rate-limiting step for the emergence of HIV from latency.

TI  - A scoring system for the follow up study of nuclear receptor coactivator
      complexes.
PG  - e014
AB  - We have systematically isolated a variety of coactivator complexes from HeLa S3
      cells using proteomic approaches. In the present report, we have evaluated twelve
      coactivator complexes involved in nuclear receptor-dependent gene transcription
      that have been purified by using an immunoprecipitation method. The twelve
      purified coactivator complexes are SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, CBP, p300, CAPER, E6-AP, 
      ASC-1, CoREST, CRSP3, CRSP2, and CDK7 containing complexes. We have identified
      153 protein components associated with these coactivator complexes using mass
      spectrometry. In order to systematically characterize the functional roles for
      these components in nuclear receptor-dependent gene transcription and their
      investigative potential, we have developed a scoring system. This scoring system 
      is comprised of biological and experimental parameters. The biological evaluation
      considers aspects such as intrinsic enzymatic activity of a protein component,
      cellular signaling processes in which protein components may be involved,
      associations with human disease, specific protein motifs, and the known
      biological roles of other interacting partners of the identified protein. In the 
      experimental evaluation, we include parameters, such as the availability of
      research materials for the functional study of the identified protein component; 
      such as full-length cDNA clones, antibodies, and commercially available knock-out
      embryonic stem (ES) cells. Each scoring parameter has been assigned an arbitrary 
      number of points according to perceived relative importance. On the basis of this
      scoring system, we prioritized each of the protein components in terms of the
      likelihood of their importance for coactivator complex networking in nuclear
      receptor-dependent gene transcription.

TI  - Phosphorylation by PKA potentiates retinoic acid receptor alpha activity by means
      of increasing interaction with and phosphorylation by cyclin H/cdk7.
PG  - 9548-53
AB  - Nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) work as ligand-dependent heterodimeric
      RAR/retinoid X receptor transcription activators, which are targets for
      phosphorylations. The N-terminal activation function (AF)-1 domain of RARalpha is
      phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 7/cyclin H complex of the
      general transcription factor TFIIH and the C-terminal AF-2 domain by the
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Here, we report the identification of a
      molecular pathway by which phosphorylation by PKA propagates cAMP signaling from 
      the AF-2 domain to the AF-1 domain. The first step is the phosphorylation of
      S369, located in loop 9-10 of the AF-2 domain. This signal is transferred to the 
      cyclin H binding domain (at the N terminus of helix 9 and loop 8-9), resulting in
      enhanced cyclin H interaction and, thereby, greater amounts of RARalpha
      phosphorylated at S77 located in the AF-1 domain by the cdk7/cyclin H complex.
      This molecular mechanism relies on the integrity of the ligand-binding domain and
      the cyclin H binding surface. Finally, it results in higher DNA-binding
      efficiency, providing an explanation for how cAMP synergizes with retinoic acid
      for transcription.

TI  - Identification of an effector protein and gain-of-function mutants that activate 
      Pfmrk, a malarial cyclin-dependent protein kinase.
PG  - 48-57
AB  - Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are key regulators of cell cycle control.
      In humans, CDK7 performs dual roles as the CDK activating kinase (CAK)
      responsible for regulating numerous CDKs and as the RNA polymerase II
      carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) kinase involved in the regulation of
      transcription. Binding of an effector protein, human MAT1, stimulates CDK7 kinase
      activity and influences substrate specificity. In Plasmodium falciparum, CDKs and
      their roles in regulating growth and development are poorly understood. In this
      study, we characterized the regulatory mechanisms of Pfmrk, a putative homolog of
      human CDK7. We identified an effector, PfMAT1, which stimulates Pfmrk kinase
      activity in a cyclin-dependent manner. The addition of PfMAT1 stimulated RNA
      polymerase II CTD phosphorylation and had no effect on the inability of Pfmrk to 
      phosphorylate PfPK5, a putative CDK1 homolog, which suggests that Pfmrk may be a 
      CTD kinase rather than a CAK. In an attempt to abrogate the requirement for
      PfMAT1 stimulation, we mutated amino acids within the active site of Pfmrk. We
      found that two independent mutants, S138K and F143L, yielded a 4-10-fold increase
      in Pfmrk activity. Significant kinase activity of these mutants was observed in
      the absence of either cyclin or PfMAT1. Finally, we observed autophosphorylation 
      of Pfmrk that is unaffected by the addition of either cyclin or PfMAT1.

TI  - Potent antitumor activity of 10-methoxy-9-nitrocamptothecin.
PG  - 962-8
AB  - The present data showed that 10-methoxy-9-nitrocamptothecin (MONCPT), a family of
      camptothecin analogues, possessed high antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.
      Cytotoxicity assays showed that MONCPT was a potential and highly efficient
      antitumor compound with IC50 values of 0.1 to 500 nmol/L in nine tumor cell
      lines. The high cytotoxic potency of MONCPT was paralleled with its ability to
      increase the cellular accumulation of DNA damage. DNA relaxation assay also
      showed that MONCPT exerted high potency as a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Moreover,
      administration of MONCPT (5-20 mg/kg) for 15 to 17 days significantly inhibited
      tumor growth in human androgen-independent prostate tumor (PC3) and human
      non-small cell lung tumor (A549) xenografts; the inhibition rates ranged from
      29.6% to 98%. The cytotoxic effect of 1,000 nmol/L of MONCPT in PC3 cells was
      associated with causing an arrest in G0-G1 phase, whereas that of 10 and 100
      nmol/L MONCPT was relative to a persistent block in G2-M phase. Furthermore,
      down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin D1 was observed in PC3 cells treated
      with 1,000 nmol/L of MONCPT, whereas overexpression of CDK7, CDK1, and cyclin B1 
      was seen in PC3 cells treated with 10 and 100 nmol/L of MONCPT. These results
      suggested that cell cycle regulation might contribute to the anticancer
      properties of MONCPT and strongly support the further anticancer development of
      MONCPT.

TI  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family member PNQALRE/CCRK supports cell
      proliferation but has no intrinsic CDK-activating kinase (CAK) activity.
PG  - 546-54
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that drive the eukaryotic cell cycle must be 
      phosphorylated within the activation segment (T-loop) by a CDK-activating kinase 
      (CAK) to achieve full activity. Although a requirement for CDK-activating
      phosphorylation is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, CAK itself has
      diverged between metazoans and budding yeast, and fission yeast has two CAKs,
      raising the possibility that additional mammalian enzymes remain to be
      identified. We report here the characterization of PNQALRE (also known as CCRK or
      p42), a member of the mammalian CDK family most similar to the cell-cycle
      effectors Cdk1 and Cdk2 and to the CAK, Cdk7. Although PNQALRE/CCRK was recently 
      proposed to activate Cdk2, we show that the monomeric protein has no intrinsic
      CAK activity. Depletion of PNQALRE by >80% due to RNA interference (RNAi) impairs
      cell proliferation, but fails to arrest the cell cycle at a discrete point.
      Instead, both the fraction of cells with a sub-G(1) DNA content and cleavage of
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) increase. PNQALRE knockdown did not diminish
      Cdk2 T-loop phosphorylation in vivo or decrease CAK activity of a cell extract.
      In contrast, depletion of Cdk7 by RNAi causes a proportional decrease in the
      ability of an extract to activate recombinant Cdk2. Our data do not support the
      proposed function of PNQALRE/CCRK in activating CDKs, but instead reinforce the
      notion of Cdk7 as the major, and to date the only, CAK in mammalian cells.

TI  - A small interfering RNA screen for modulators of tumor cell motility identifies
      MAP4K4 as a promigratory kinase.
PG  - 3775-80
AB  - Cell motility is a complex biological process, involved in development,
      inflammation, homeostasis, and pathological processes such as the invasion and
      metastatic spread of cancer. Here, we describe a genomic screen designed to
      identify inhibitors of cell migration. A library of 10,996 small interfering RNAs
      (targeting 5,234 human genes) was screened for their ability to block the
      migration of a highly motile ovarian carcinoma cell line, SKOV-3, by using a
      384-well wound-healing assay coupled with automated microscopy and wound
      quantification. Two or more small interfering RNAs against four genes, CDK7,
      DYRK1B, MAP4K4 (NIK/HGK) (MAP4K4, mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4), and
      SCCA-1 (SerpinB3), potently blocked the migration of SKOV-3 cells, concordant
      with reduced transcript levels. Further studies of the promigratory role of
      MAP4K4 showed that the knockdown of this transcript inhibited the migration of
      multiple carcinoma cell lines, indicating a broad role in cell motility and
      potently suppressed the invasion of SKOV-3 cells in vitro. The effect of MAP4K4
      on cellular migration was found to be mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase,
      independent of AP1 activation and downstream transcription. Accordingly, small
      molecule inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase suppressed SKOV-3 cell migration, 
      underscoring the potential therapeutic utility of mitogen-activated protein
      kinase pathway inhibition in cancer progression.

TI  - Sex-dependent gene expression in early brain development of chicken embryos.
PG  - 12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Differentiation of the brain during development leads to sexually
      dimorphic adult reproductive behavior and other neural sex dimorphisms. Genetic
      mechanisms independent of steroid hormones produced by the gonads have recently
      been suggested to partly explain these dimorphisms. RESULTS: Using cDNA
      microarrays and real-time PCR we found gene expression differences between the
      male and female embryonic brain (or whole head) that may be independent of
      morphological differentiation of the gonads. Genes located on the sex chromosomes
      (ZZ in males and ZW in females) were common among the differentially expressed
      genes, several of which (WPKCI-8, HINT, MHM non-coding RNA) have previously been 
      implicated in avian sex determination. A majority of the identified genes were
      more highly expressed in males. Three of these genes (CDK7, CCNH and BTF2-P44)
      encode subunits of the transcription factor IIH complex, indicating a role for
      this complex in neuronal differentiation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study
      provides novel insights into sexually dimorphic gene expression in the embryonic 
      chicken brain and its possible involvement in sex differentiation of the nervous 
      system in birds.

TI  - Activated Src abrogates the Myc requirement for the G0/G1 transition but not for 
      the G1/S transition.
PG  - 2695-700
AB  - The transcription factor Myc plays a central role in the control of cellular
      proliferation. Myc expression is induced by growth factors in a pathway mediated 
      by cellular Src (c-Src), but it is not clear whether Myc induction or activity is
      required for malignant transformation by activated Src. We introduced v-Src into 
      a c-myc(-/-) derivative of Rat-1 fibroblasts and into 3T9 mouse fibroblasts
      harboring a conditionally excisable c-myc allele. Expression of activated viral
      Src in Myc-deficient cells led to loss of actin stress fibers and surface
      fibronectin, indicating that Myc is dispensable for v-Src-induced morphological
      transformation. However, v-Src failed to rescue the proliferative defect
      resulting from the loss of Myc. In Myc-deficient cells, despite its inability to 
      overcome this proliferation block, v-Src was able to regulate the expression of
      certain Myc transcriptional targets and induce the expression of active cyclin
      D/Cdk4 and Cdk6 complexes; it also induced the phosphorylation of Rb, albeit at
      reduced levels. In contrast, however, in the absence of Myc, the level of Cdk2
      kinase activity was drastically reduced. This reduction in Cdk2 activity was
      associated with a decrease in the expression of Cdk7, Cdc25A, and cyclin A.
      Coexpression of Cdk2 plus cyclin E and/or cyclin A rescued the G1/S block and
      allowed the cells to enter mitosis. These results indicate that in the absence of
      Myc, v-Src can activate early G1 cell cycle regulators but fails to activate
      regulators of the late G1/S transition.

TI  - Expression of cyclin H in normal and cancerous endometrium, its correlation with 
      other cyclins, and association with clinicopathologic parameters.
PG  - 402-8
AB  - Cyclins are known as regulatory proteins in cell cycle. Cyclin H is a part of
      cyclin H/Cdk7/Mat1 complex, which is necessary for cellular proliferation. This
      study was designed to investigate the correlation of cyclin H expression with
      tumorigenesis of the endometrium and clinicopathologic variables.
      Immunohistochemical staining using labeled streptavidin-biotin complex was
      performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded endometrial tissues of the
      proliferative, hyperplastic, and carcinomatous types. Immunostaining for cyclins 
      A, B1, D1, D3, E, H, and cyclin dependent kinase 2 were evaluated. The expression
      of cyclins A, D1, D3, and H in hyperplasia was significantly more frequent than
      those of proliferative phase and less than those of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. 
      The expression of cyclin H was correlated with lymphvascular space invasion and
      clinical stage in carcinoma but not with myometrial invasion, lymph node
      metastasis, and menopause status. The expression of cyclin H could be involved in
      the transformation of the endometrium into malignancy and might be a marker for
      more proliferative and malignant features. It might be one of the biomarkers for 
      determining proliferative activity in endometrial hyperplasia and endometrioid
      adenocarcinoma.

TI  - AZ703, an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2,
      induces E2F-1-dependent apoptosis enhanced by depletion of cyclin-dependent
      kinase 9.
PG  - 435-44
AB  - Preclinical studies were performed of a novel selective imidazopyridine
      cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, AZ703. In vitro kinase assays showed
      that IC50 values for AZ703 against purified cyclin E/cdk2 and cyclin B/cdk1 were 
      34 and 29 nmol/L, respectively. In contrast, the IC50 against cdk4 was 10
      micromol/L. AZ703 also inhibited cdk7 and cdk9 with IC50 values of 2.1 micromol/L
      and 521 nmol/L, respectively. Treatment of U2OS, NCI-H1299, and A549 cells for 24
      hours resulted in growth arrest involving multiple cell cycle phases. At low drug
      concentrations (< 2 micromol/L), G2 arrest predominated, whereas at higher
      concentrations (> or = 2 micromol/L), S-G2 arrest was observed. When cells were
      synchronized in G1 by starvation and released into AZ703, a block in G1 occurred 
      that was not evident in exponentially growing cells. Cell cycle arrest was
      associated with reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and
      p27(Kip1) at cdk2 phospho-sites. Following longer exposures, apoptosis was
      evident. Cells were further sensitized to AZ703 following recruitment to S phase 
      by synchronization. Consistent with the inhibition of cdks during S and G2 that
      modulate the activity and stability of E2F-1, AZ703 treatment induced E2F-1
      expression. In U2OS and NCI-H1299 cells engineered to inducibly express the
      dominant-negative mutant E2F-1 (1-374), expression of the mutant decreased
      AZ703-mediated apoptosis, indicating dependence on E2F-1 transcriptional targets.
      AZ703-induced apoptosis in NCI-H1299 cells was enhanced by small interfering
      RNA-mediated depletion of cdk9, which caused reduced levels of Mcl-1 and XIAP,
      suggesting that cdk2, cdk1, and cdk9 represent a rational subset of family
      members for drug targeting.

TI  - Dichotomous but stringent substrate selection by the dual-function Cdk7 complex
      revealed by chemical genetics.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - Cdk7 performs two essential but distinct functions as a CDK-activating kinase
      (CAK) required for cell-cycle progression and as the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
      CTD kinase of general transcription factor IIH. To investigate the substrate
      specificity underlying this dual function, we created an analog-sensitive (AS)
      Cdk7 able to use bulky ATP derivatives. Cdk7-AS-cyclin H-Mat1 phosphorylates
      approximately 10-15 endogenous polypeptides in nuclear extracts. We identify
      seven of these as known and previously unknown Cdk7 substrates that define two
      classes: proteins such as Pol II and transcription elongation factor Spt5,
      recognized efficiently only by the fully activated Cdk7 complex, through
      sequences surrounding the site of phosphorylation; and CDKs, targeted
      equivalently by all active forms of Cdk7, dependent on substrate motifs remote
      from the phosphoacceptor residue. Thus, Cdk7 accomplishes dual functions in
      cell-cycle control and transcription not through promiscuity but through
      distinct, stringent modes of substrate recognition.

TI  - Human cytomegalovirus infection induces specific hyperphosphorylation of the
      carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II that is
      associated with changes in the abundance, activity, and localization of cdk9 and 
      cdk7.
PG  - 15477-93
AB  - Human cytomegalovirus infection in the presence of the cyclin-dependent kinase
      (cdk) inhibitor roscovitine leads to changes in differential splicing and the
      polyadenylation of immediate early IE1/IE2 and UL37 transcripts (V. Sanchez, A.
      K. McElroy, J. Yen, S. Tamrakar, C. L. Clark, R. A. Schwartz, and D. H. Spector, 
      J. Virol. 78:11219-11232, 2004). To determine if this was associated with
      specific phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II 
      (RNAP II) large subunit by cdk7/cyclin H and cdk9/cyclin T1, we examined the
      expression and localization of these kinases and the various phosphorylated forms
      of RNAP II. Infection resulted in increased RNAP II CTD phosphorylated on serines
      2 and 5 and increased levels of activity of cdk7 and cdk9. At early times, cdk9
      localizes with input viral DNA, and aggregates of cdk9 and cdk7 and a subset of
      Ser2-phosphorylated RNAP II colocalize with IE1/IE2 proteins adjacent to
      promyelocytic leukemia protein oncogenic domains. Later, cdk9 and
      Ser2-phosphorylated RNAP II form a nuclear punctate pattern; cdk7 resides in
      replication centers, and Ser5-phosphorylated RNAP II clusters at the peripheries 
      of replication centers. Roscovitine treatment leads to decreased levels of
      hyperphosphorylated RNAP II (RNAP IIo) in infected cells and of
      hypophosphorylated RNAP II in mock-infected and infected cells. The RNAP IIo
      decrease does not occur if roscovitine is added 8 h postinfection, as was
      previously observed for processing of IE transcripts. These results suggest that 
      accurate IE gene expression requires specific phosphorylation of the RNAP II CTD 
      early in infection.

TI  - Cdk2: a genuine protein kinase client of Hsp90 and Cdc37.
PG  - 15287-95
AB  - Hsp90 and its cochaperone Cdc37 cooperate to provide requisite support to
      numerous protein kinases involved in cellular signal transduction. In this
      report, we studied the interactions of Hsp90 and Cdc37 with the cyclin-dependent 
      kinase, Cdk2. Treatment of K562 cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin,
      caused a 75% reduction in Cdk2 levels and reduced the levels of its activating
      kinase, Cdk7, by more than 60%, suggesting that both of these kinases may be
      Hsp90 clients. Using classical pull-down assays and the Hsp90 inhibitory agents
      geldanamycin and molybdate, Cdk2 is shown to be a genuine client of the Hsp90
      chaperone complex. Subsequently, pull-down assays directed at helix alphaC of
      Cdk2 are shown to disrupt Hsp90 and Cdc37 binding and explain the initial
      difficulties in demonstrating these interactions. Mutant constructs containing
      deletions of secondary structural elements from the N- and C-termini of Cdk2 were
      prepared and assayed for their ability to coadsorb Hsp90 and Cdc37 in a
      salt-stable high-affinity manner with and without the addition of molybdate.
      Consistent with similar work done with the cyclin-dependent kinase relative Cdk4,
      the presence of the G-box motif of Cdk2 was shown to be critical for Cdc37
      binding, whereas consistent with work done with the Src-family tyrosine kinase
      Lck, the presence of helix alphaC and the stabilization of helix alphaE were
      shown to be needed for Hsp90 binding.

TI  - Secrets of a double agent: CDK7 in cell-cycle control and transcription.
PG  - 5171-80
AB  - In metazoans, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has essential roles in both the
      cell-division cycle and transcription, as a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) and as a 
      component of the general transcription factor TFIIH, respectively. Controversy
      over its double duty has been resolved, but questions remain. First, how does
      CDK7 achieve the dual substrate specificity necessary to perform both roles?
      Second, is there a deeper connection implied by the dichotomy of CDK7 function,
      for example similar mechanisms controlling cell division and gene expression,
      and/or actual coordination of the two processes? Enzymological studies have
      revealed solutions to the unusual substrate recognition problem, and there is
      evidence that the distinct functions of CDK7 can be regulated independently.
      Finally, despite divergence in their wiring, the CAK-CDK networks of budding
      yeast, fission yeast and metazoans all link transcriptional regulation with
      operation of the cell-cycle machinery. This connection might help to ensure that 
      mRNAs encoding effectors of cell division are expressed at the right time in the 
      cycle.

TI  - Cyclin H binding to the RARalpha activation function (AF)-2 domain directs
      phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain by cyclin-dependent kinase 7.
PG  - 16608-13
AB  - The transcriptional activity of nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which act
      as RAR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers, depends on two activation
      functions, AF-1 and AF-2, which are targets for phosphorylations and synergize
      for the activation of retinoic acid target genes. The N-terminal AF-1 domain of
      RARalpha is phosphorylated at S77 by the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-activating
      kinase (CAK) subcomplex (cdk7/cyclin H/MAT1) of the general transcription factor 
      TFIIH. Here, we show that phosphorylation of S77 governing the transcriptional
      activity of RARalpha depends on cyclin H binding at a RARalpha region that
      encompasses loop 8-9 and the N-terminal tip of helix 9 of the AF-2 domain. We
      propose a model in which the structural constraints of this region control the
      architecture of the RAR/RXR/TFIIH complex and therefore the efficiency of
      RARalpha phosphorylation by cdk7. To our knowledge, this study provides the first
      example of a cooperation between the AF-2 and AF-1 domains of RARs through a
      kinase complex.

TI  - Targeting malaria with specific CDK inhibitors.
PG  - 160-70
AB  - Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are attractive targets for drug discovery
      and efforts have led to the identification of novel CDK selective inhibitors in
      the development of treatments for cancers, neurological disorders, and infectious
      diseases. More recently, they have become the focus of rational drug design
      programs for the development of new antimalarial agents. CDKs are valid targets
      as they function as essential regulators of cell growth and differentiation. To
      date, several CDKs have been characterized from the genome of the malaria-causing
      protozoan Plasmodium falciparum. Our approach employs experimental and virtual
      screening methodologies to identify and refine chemical inhibitors of the
      parasite CDK Pfmrk, a sequence homologue of human CDK7. Chemotypes of Pfmrk
      inhibitors include the purines, quinolinones, oxindoles, and chalcones, which
      have sub-micromolar IC50 values against the parasite enzyme, but not the human
      CDKs. Additionally, we have developed and validated a pharmacophore, based on
      Pfmrk inhibitors, which contains two hydrogen bond acceptor functions and two
      hydrophobic sites, including one aromatic ring hydrophobic site. This
      pharmacophore has been exploited to identify additional compounds that
      demonstrate significant inhibitory activity against Pfmrk. A molecular model of
      Pfmrk designed using the crystal structure of human CDK7 highlights key amino
      acid substitutions in the ATP binding pocket. Molecular modeling and docking of
      the active site pocket with selective inhibitors has identified possible
      receptor-ligand interactions that may be responsible for inhibitor specificity.
      Overall, the unique biochemical characteristics associated with this protein, to 
      include distinctive active site amino acid residues and variable inhibitor
      profiles, distinguishes the Pfmrk drug screen as a paradigm for CDK inhibitor
      analysis in the parasite.

TI  - Variolin B and its derivate deoxy-variolin B: new marine natural compounds with
      cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor activity.
PG  - 2366-77
AB  - Variolin B (VAR-B) is a natural product isolated from the sponge Kirkpatrickia
      variolosa, found in Antarctica. VAR-B has been shown previously to possess potent
      pro-apoptotic activity. This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of
      action of chemically synthesised VAR-B and its analogue deoxy-variolin B
      (dVAR-B). In different human cancer cell lines both compounds inhibited colony
      formation, caused cell cycle perturbations and induced apoptosis at
      concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 microM. LoVo/Dx cells over-expressing Pgp
      were equally sensitive as the parental cell line to VAR-B and dVAR-B, indicating 
      that variolins are not substrates of Pgp. Although variolins induced an increase 
      in the levels of p53 with an increase in p21, their cytotoxicities did not appear
      to be dependent on p53 status as their potency was comparable in cells with
      wild-type p53, or in sub-lines with inactivated p53. Both VAR-B and dVAR-B
      prevent the cells from entering S phase, blocking cells in G1 and cause an
      accumulation of cells in G2. The apoptosis induced by VAR-B and dVAR-B occurs
      very rapidly in some cell lines (e.g., Jurkat leukaemia cells) and is already
      evident 4h after the beginning of treatment. Although intercalation of dVAR-B in 
      DNA has been demonstrated, neither VAR-B nor dVAR-B produce detectable breaks in 
      DNA. These results are consistent with the in vitro biochemical assays that also 
      demonstrated that dVAR-B is not topoisomerase I or II poison. Instead, each of
      these variolins appears to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the muM
      range. CDK1-cyclin B, CDK2-cyclin A and CDK2/cylin E complexes were inhibited in 
      a range of concentrations lower than those required to inhibit the activity of
      CDK4/cyclin D or CDK7/cyclin H complexes. In conclusion, these variolins are a
      new class of CDK inhibitors that activate apoptosis in a p53-independent fashion 
      and thus they may be effective against tumours with p53 mutations or deletions.

TI  - Signalling responses linked to betulinic acid-induced apoptosis are antagonized
      by MEK inhibitor U0126 in adherent or 3D spheroid melanoma irrespective of p53
      status.
PG  - 1135-43
AB  - MEK1/2 inhibitors like U0126 can potentiate or antagonize the antitumor activity 
      of cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin, paclitaxel or vinblastine, depending on
      the drug or the target cells. We now investigated whether U0126, differentially
      regulates melanoma signaling in response to UV radiation or betulinic acid, a
      drug lethal against melanoma. This report shows that U0126 inhibits early
      response (ERK) kinase activation and cyclin A expression in wt p53 C8161 melanoma
      exposed to either UV radiation or betulinic acid. However, U0126 does not protect
      from UV damage, but counteracts betulinic acid-mediated apoptosis in the same
      cells. Protection from the latter drug by joint treatment with U0126 was also
      evident in wt p53 MelJuso melanoma and mutant p53 WM164 melanoma. The latter
      cells were the most responsive to betulinic acid, showing a selective decline in 
      the cdk4 protein, without a comparable change in other key cell cycle proteins
      like cdc2, cdk2, cdk7 or cyclin A, prior to apoptosis-associated PARP
      fragmentation. Laser scanning cytometry also showed that betulinic acid induced a
      significant increase in chromatin condensation in WM164 melanoma irrespective of 
      whether they were in adherent form or as multicellular spheroids. All these
      betulinic acid-induced changes were counteracted by U0126. Our data show for the 
      first time that (a) cdk4 protein is an early target of betulinic acid-induced
      apoptosis and (b) unrestricted ERK signaling favours betulinic acid-induced
      apoptosis, but this is counteracted by U0126, partly through counteracting
      chromatin condensation and restoring Akt activation decreased by betulinic acid
      treatment.

TI  - Analysis of U1 small nuclear RNA interaction with cyclin H.
PG  - 36920-5
AB  - TFIIH is a general transcription and repair factor implicated in RNA polymerase
      II transcription, nucleotide excision repair, and transcription-coupled repair.
      Genetic defects in TFIIH lead to three distinct inheritable diseases: xeroderma
      pigmentosa, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy, with xeroderma pigmentosa
      patients being highly susceptible to skin cancer. Earlier data revealed that the 
      cyclin H subunit of TFIIH associates with U1 small nuclear RNA, a core-splicing
      component. In addition to its role in RNA processing U1 small nuclear RNA also
      regulates diverse stages of transcription by RNA polymerase II both in vivo and
      in vitro, including abortive initiation and re-initiation. Here we identify
      structural components of U1 and cyclin H implicated in the direct interaction and
      show how they affect function. Because of unique features of cyclin H we have
      developed a new methodology for mapping RNA interaction with the full-length
      cyclin H polypeptide based on electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
      We also demonstrate the importance of U1 stem-loops 1 and 2 for the interaction
      with cyclin H. Functional assays implicate the identified interaction with U1 in 
      regulation of the activity of the cyclin H associated kinase CDK7.

TI  - Antiproliferative activity of olomoucine II, a novel 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine 
      cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.
PG  - 1763-71
AB  - The study describes the protein kinase selectivity profile, as well as the
      binding mode of olomoucine II in the catalytic cleft of CDK2, as determined from 
      cocrystal analysis. Apart from the main cell cycle-regulating kinase CDK2,
      olomoucine II exerts specificity for CDK7 and CDK9, with important functions in
      the regulation of RNA transcription. In vitro anticancer activity of the
      inhibitor in a panel of tumor cell lines shows a wide potency range with a slight
      preference for cells harboring a wild-type p53 gene. Cell-based assays confirmed 
      activation of p53 protein levels and events leading to accumulation of p21(WAF1).
      Additionally, in olomoucine II-treated cells, Mdm2 was found to form a complex
      with the ribosomal protein L11, which inhibits Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase function. We
      conclude that perturbations in RNA synthesis may lead to activation of p53 and
      that this contributes to the antiproliferative potency of cyclindependent kinase 
      inhibitors.

      series of potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.
PG  - 4535-46
AB  - On the basis of previous studies, we identified pyrazine-pyridine A as a potent
      vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor and pyrimidine-pyridine B as a
      moderately potent cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. A proposed combination
      of CGP-60474 and compound B led to the discovery of [1,3,5]triazine-pyridine as a
      new series of potent CDK inhibitors. Palladium-catalyzed C-C bond formation
      reactions, particularly the Negishi coupling reaction, were used to assemble
      various triazine-heteroaryl analogues effectively. Among them, compound 20
      displayed high inhibitory potency at CDK1 (IC(50) = 0.021 microM), CDK2, and CDK5
      and submicromolar potency at CDK4, CDK6, and CDK7. Compound 20 also displayed
      high potency at GSK-3beta. It demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity on
      various tumor cell lines, including HeLa, HCT-116, U937, and A375. When 20 was
      administered intraperitoneally at 150 and 125 mg/kg to nude mice bearing human
      A375 xenografts, the compound produced a significant survival increase. Molecular
      docking studies were conducted in an attempt to enhance the understanding of the 
      observed structure-activity relationship.

TI  - Dysregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor target genes by
      XPD mutations.
PG  - 6065-76
AB  - Mutations in the XPD subunit of TFIIH give rise to human genetic disorders
      initially defined as DNA repair syndromes. Nevertheless, xeroderma pigmentosum
      (XP) group D (XP-D) patients develop clinical features such as hypoplasia of the 
      adipose tissue, implying a putative transcriptional defect. Knowing that
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are implicated in lipid
      metabolism, we investigated the expression of PPAR target genes in the adipose
      tissues and the livers of XPD-deficient mice and found that (i) some genes are
      abnormally overexpressed in a ligand-independent manner which parallels an
      increase in the recruitment of RNA polymerase (pol) II but not PPARs on their
      promoter and (ii) upon treatment with PPAR ligands, other genes are much less
      induced compared to the wild type, which is due to a lower recruitment of both
      PPARs and RNA pol II. The defect in transactivation by PPARs is likely
      attributable to their weaker phosphorylation by the cdk7 kinase of TFIIH. Having 
      identified the phosphorylated residues in PPAR isotypes, we demonstrate how their
      transactivation defect in XPD-deficient cells can be circumvented by
      overexpression of either a wild-type XPD or a constitutively phosphorylated PPAR 
      S/E. This work emphasizes that underphosphorylation of PPARs affects their
      transactivation and consequently the expression of PPAR target genes, thus
      contributing in part to the XP-D phenotype.

TI  - Cyclin H is targeted to the nucleus by C-terminal nuclear localization sequences.
PG  - 1379-87
AB  - Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) is a trimeric complex consisting of cdk7, cyclin H,
      and MAT1, which activates the cell-cycle-regulating cdks through T loop
      phosphorylation. In addition, other substrates of the CAK complex have been
      identified when CAK is assembled with the TFIIH core proteins, thereby regulating
      transcription and nucleotide excision repair. Little is known about the
      regulation of the CAK complex through cyclin H. In this study we further analyzed
      cyclin H regulation and identified two basic clusters in the C terminus of the
      protein as putative nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). Fusion constructs of
      full-length and truncated cyclin H sequences demonstrated the functionality of
      the NLSs. A peptide-binding assay revealed that at least one NLS interacts with
      the nuclear import receptors importin alpha/beta. Phosphorylation in the vicinity
      of the NLSs by cyclin C/cdk8 or protein kinase CK2, however, does not influence
      the nuclear translocation of cyclin H.

TI  - Seliciclib (CYC202, R-Roscovitine) induces cell death in multiple myeloma cells
      by inhibition of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and down-regulation of
      Mcl-1.
PG  - 5399-407
AB  - Seliciclib (CYC202, R-roscovitine) is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor
      that competes for the ATP binding site on the kinase. It has greatest activity
      against CDK2/cyclin E, CDK7/cyclin H, and CDK9/cyclin T. Seliciclib induces
      apoptosis from all phases of the cell cycle in tumor cell lines, reduces tumor
      growth in xenografts in nude mice and is currently in phase II clinical trials.
      This study investigated the mechanism of cell death in multiple myeloma cells
      treated with seliciclib. In myeloma cells treated in vitro, seliciclib induced
      rapid dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of
      RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation at these sites is crucial for RNA polymerase
      II-dependent transcription. Inhibition of transcription would be predicted to
      exert its greatest effect on gene products where both mRNA and protein have short
      half-lives, resulting in rapid decline of the protein levels. One such gene
      product is the antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1, crucial for the survival of a range of
      cell types including multiple myeloma. As hypothesized, following the inhibition 
      of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, seliciclib caused rapid Mcl-1
      down-regulation, which preceded the induction of apoptosis. The importance of
      Mcl-1 was confirmed by short interfering RNA, demonstrating that reducing Mcl-1
      levels alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis. These results suggest that
      seliciclib causes myeloma cell death by disrupting the balance between cell
      survival and apoptosis through the inhibition of transcription and
      down-regulation of Mcl-1. This study provides the scientific rationale for the
      clinical development of seliciclib for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

TI  - Varicella-zoster virus IE63 protein phosphorylation by roscovitine-sensitive
      cyclin-dependent kinases modulates its cellular localization and activity.
PG  - 29135-43
AB  - During the first stage of Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) infection, IE63 (immediate
      early 63 protein) is mostly expressed in the nucleus and also slightly in the
      cytoplasm, and during latency, IE63 localizes in the cytoplasm quite exclusively.
      Because phosphorylation is known to regulate various cellular mechanisms, we
      investigated the impact of phosphorylation by roscovitine-sensitive
      cyclin-dependent kinase (RSC) on the localization and functional properties of
      IE63. We demonstrated first that IE63 was phosphorylated on Ser-224 in vitro by
      CDK1 and CDK5 but not by CDK2, CDK7, or CDK9. Furthermore, by using roscovitine
      and CDK1 inhibitor III (CiIII), we showed that CDK1 phosphorylated IE63 on
      Ser-224 in vivo. By mutagenesis and the use of inhibitors, we demonstrated that
      phosphorylation on Ser-224 was important for the correct localization of the
      protein. Indeed, the substitution of these residues by alanine led to an
      exclusive nuclear localization of the protein, whereas mutations into glutamic
      acid did not modify its subcellular distribution. When transfected or
      VZV-infected cells were treated with roscovitine or CiIII, an exclusive nuclear
      localization of IE63 was also observed. By using a transfection assay, we also
      showed that phosphorylation on Ser-224 and Thr-222 was essential for the
      down-regulation of the basal activity of the VZV DNA polymerase gene promoter.
      Similarly, roscovitine and CiIII impaired these properties of the wild-type form 
      of IE63. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of CDK1-mediated 
      IE63 phosphorylation for a correct distribution of IE63 between both cellular
      compartments and for its repressive activity toward the promoter tested.

TI  - An alliance between Ras GTPase-activating protein, filamin C, and Ras
      GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein regulates myocyte growth.
PG  - 25717-28
AB  - We have previously reported that Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) is
      involved in a pathway that regulates total cellular mRNA and protein synthesis in
      cardiac myocytes. A yeast two-hybrid screen resulted in identification of filamin
      C (FLN-C) as one of its targets. Knockdown of RasGAP or FLN-C, or severing their 
      interaction, resulted in down-regulation of the RNA polymerase II kinase,
      cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7). This appeared to be provoked by the release of 
      cdk7 mRNA from RasGAP SH3 domain-binding protein, G3BP, and its subsequent
      degradation. In parallel, myocyte growth was also inhibited. On the other hand,
      overexpression of RasGAP induced a Cdk7- and FLN-C-dependent growth. Thus, we
      propose that the physical interaction between RasGAP and FLN-C facilitates an
      interaction between G3BP and cdk7 mRNA. This results in stabilization of cdk7
      mRNA, an increase in its protein, which is required for cell growth.

TI  - CAK-Cyclin-dependent Activating Kinase: a key kinase in cell cycle control and a 
      target for drugs?
PG  - 572-7
AB  - The Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) Activating Kinase (CAK) is responsible for the 
      activating phosphorylation of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 and regulation of the
      cell cycle. The kinase is composed of three subunits: CDK7, Cyclin H and MAT1
      (menage a trois). Together with six other subunits, CAK is also part of the
      general transcription factor TFIIH where it is involved in promoter clearance and
      progression of transcription from the preinitiation to the initiation stage. CAK 
      is required for cell cycle progression, which suggests that CDK7 could be a
      target for cancer therapy. However its role in transcription and its ubiquitous
      presence raise sensible concerns about possible toxicity of its inhibitors. The
      recently determined structure of CDK7 allows the design of inhibitors with
      differential specificity for the different CDKs. We review the role of CAK in
      different biological processes and evaluate the biological evidence for CDK7 as a
      possible pharmacological target.

TI  - Recent advances in the development of selective small molecule inhibitors for
      cyclin-dependent kinases.
PG  - 167-79
AB  - Loss of normal cell cycle regulation is the hallmark of human cancers, and
      alteration of the components involved in cell cycle regulation occurs in most
      human tumors. This suggests that Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) are an
      attractive target for the development of pharmacological agents for the treatment
      of cancer. Recently, CDK family members that are not directly involved in cell
      cycle regulation have been identified. This includes CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9, which 
      participate in transcription regulation, and CDK5, which plays a role in neuronal
      and secretory functions. Given the involvement of CDKs in multiple cellular
      processes, development of selective small molecule inhibitors for specific CDKs
      is expected to help clarify whether improved specificity of cell cycle CDK
      inhibitors will enhance their therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.
      Selective inhibitors are also needed as tools to explore the biology of diseases 
      in which CDKs may participate and to help develop therapeutics to treat them.
      Intensive screening and drug design based on CDK/inhibitor co-crystal structure
      and SAR studies have led to the identification of a large variety of chemical
      inhibitors of CDKs. Although they are competitive with ATP at the catalytic site,
      their kinase selectivity varies greatly, and inhibitors selective for certain
      CDKs have begun to be identified. There are currently two categories of selective
      CDK inhibitors: those that are selective for CDK2 and CDK1 and those that are
      selective for CDK4/6. These two types of inhibitors have different effects on
      tumor cells and are expected to be useful in the treatment of cancer.

TI  - In vitro activity of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CYC202 (Seliciclib,
      R-roscovitine) in mantle cell lymphomas.
PG  - 1169-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has the worst prognosis of all B-cell
      lymphomas and has poor response to conventional therapy. It is characterized by
      the presence of a chromosomal translocation t(11:14) (q13;q32) which results in
      deregulated cyclin D1 expression. Since defects in cell cycle regulation and
      apoptosis are primary events in MCL, small-molecule inhibitors of cdks-cyclins
      may play an important role in the therapy of this disorder. CYC202 (Seliciclib,
      R-roscovitine; Cyclacel Ltd., Dundee, UK) is a purine analogue and a selective
      inhibitor of the cdk2-cyclin E as well as cdk7-cyclin H and cdk9-cyclin T.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activity of CYC202 was tested in four human MCL cell
      lines: REC, Granta-519, JeKo-1 and NCEB-1. The effect of CYC202 on the cell cycle
      and on apoptosis-, cell-cycle- and transcription-regulation-related proteins was 
      assessed. RESULTS: The IC50 was 25 microM for REC, Granta-519 and JeKo-1 cells
      and 50 microM for NCEB-1 cells. CYC202 caused an accumulation of cells in the
      G2-M phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis. CYC202 caused down-regulation of
      cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 protein levels, possibly because of the inhibition of
      transcription elongation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CYC202 is an active 
      agent in MCL. The concomitant decrease of the phosphorylated and total forms of
      RNA polymerase II suggests that this could be the main mechanism mediating the
      biological effects of CYC202 in MCL cells. The drug might represent a new
      therapeutic agent in this lymphoma subtype.

TI  - Impairment of the TFIIH-associated CDK-activating kinase selectively affects cell
      cycle-regulated gene expression in fission yeast.
PG  - 2734-45
AB  - The fission yeast Mcs6-Mcs2-Pmh1 complex, homologous to metazoan Cdk7-cyclin
      H-Mat1, has dual functions in cell division and transcription: as a partially
      redundant cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) that
      phosphorylates the major cell cycle CDK, Cdc2, on Thr-167; and as the RNA
      polymerase (Pol) II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) kinase associated with
      transcription factor (TF) IIH. We analyzed conditional mutants of mcs6 and pmh1, 
      which activate Cdc2 normally but cannot complete cell division at restrictive
      temperature and arrest with decreased CTD phosphorylation. Transcriptional
      profiling by microarray hybridization revealed only modest effects on global gene
      expression: a one-third reduction in a severe mcs6 mutant after prolonged
      incubation at 36 degrees C. In contrast, a small subset of transcripts (
      approximately 5%) decreased by more than twofold after Mcs6 complex function was 
      compromised. The signature of repressed genes overlapped significantly with those
      of cell separation mutants sep10 and sep15. Sep10, a component of the Pol II
      Mediator complex, becomes essential in mcs6 or pmh1 mutant backgrounds. Moreover,
      transcripts dependent on the forkhead transcription factor Sep1, which are
      expressed coordinately during mitosis, were repressed in Mcs6 complex mutants,
      and Mcs6 also interacts genetically with Sep1. Thus, the Mcs6 complex, a direct
      activator of Cdc2, also influences the cell cycle transcriptional program,
      possibly through its TFIIH-associated kinase function.

TI  - Rational inhibitor design and iterative screening in the identification of
      selective plasmodial cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors.
PG  - 27-38
AB  - New chemical classes of compounds must be introduced into the malaria drug
      development pipeline in an effort to develop new chemotherapy options for the
      fight against malaria. In this review we describe an iterative approach designed 
      to identify potent inhibitors of a kinase family that collectively functions as
      key regulators of the cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are
      attractive drug targets in numerous diseases and, most recently, they have become
      the focus of rational drug design programs for the development of new
      antimalarial agents. Our approach uses experimental and virtual screening
      methodologies to identify and refine chemical inhibitors and increase the success
      rate of discovering potent and selective inhibitors. The active pockets of the
      plasmodial CDKs are unique in terms of size, shape and amino acid composition
      compared with those of the mammalian orthologues. These differences exemplified
      through the use of screening assays, molecular modeling, and crystallography can 
      be exploited for inhibitor design. To date, several classes of compounds
      including quinolines and oxindoles have been identified as selective inhibitors
      of the plasmodial CDK7 homologue, Pfmrk. From these initial studies and through
      the iterative rational drug design process, more potent, selective, and most
      importantly, chemically unique compound classes have been identified as effective
      inhibitors of the plasmodial CDKs and the malarial parasite.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat interacts with LIS1 protein.
PG  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-1 Tat activates transcription of HIV-1 viral genes by inducing
      phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Tat
      can also disturb cellular metabolism by inhibiting proliferation of
      antigen-specific T lymphocytes and by inducing cellular apoptosis. Tat-induced
      apoptosis of T-cells is attributed, in part, to the distortion of microtubules
      polymerization. LIS1 is a microtubule-associated protein that facilitates
      microtubule polymerization. RESULTS: We identified here LIS1 as a Tat-interacting
      protein during extensive biochemical fractionation of T-cell extracts. We found
      several proteins to co-purify with a Tat-associated RNAPII CTD kinase activity
      including LIS1, CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1. Tat interacted with LIS1 but not with
      CDK7, cyclin H or MAT1 in vitro. LIS1 also co-immunoprecipitated with Tat
      expressed in HeLa cells. Further, LIS1 interacted with Tat in a yeast two-hybrid 
      system. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Tat interacts with LIS1 in vitro
      and in vivo and that this interaction might contribute to the effect of Tat on
      microtubule formation.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase/Cdk7 co-localizes with PKC-iota in
      human glioma cells.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase (CAK) is a trimeric complex composed of
      cdk7, cyclin H and MAT1. CAK/cdk7 functions as a master cell cycle regulator by
      phosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinases for cell cycle progression. We have
      previously reported that protein kinase C-iota (PKC-iota) associates with
      CAK/cdk7. In this investigation, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used 
      to provide further evidence for the co-localization of PKC-iota with CAK/cdk7.
      PKC-iota was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescent dye) and CAK/cdk7
      was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (red fluorescent dye). The fusion of the red and
      green fluorescent colors produced a yellow color, which was used to quantify
      co-localization of PKC-iota and CAK/cdk7. Confocal microscopy revealed the
      co-localization of PKC-iota with CAK/cdk7 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of
      U-373 MG cells.

TI  - [Effect of CDK7 gene silencing against hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell proliferation].
PG  - 58-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODN) that inhibit
      cultured hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell proliferation, and evaluate the
      antiproliferative potency of modified ASODN. METHODS: ASODN sequences were
      selected based on the secondary structure of human CDK7 mRNA predicted with
      RNAStructure 3.71 software. The binding thermodynamics of CDK7 mRNA to ASODN was 
      analyzed by OligoWalk program. The sequences with the strongest effect against
      cultured HepG2 cell proliferation in vitro were selected, and the fragments
      complementary to 1-5 bases upstream or downstream to the complementary region
      were structurally modified and screened. RESULTS: The partial phosphorothioate
      ASODN complementary to 284-303 region of human CDK7 mRNA was the most powerful
      inhibitor, and the antiproliferative activity reached 40.4+/-12.6%; in the second
      round of screening, the antiproliferative activity of the full phosphorothioate
      ASODN complementary to the 287-306 region of the mRNA on HepG2 cells was
      68.3+/-2.6%, with IC50 of 51.9+/-8.6 nmol/L. CONCLUSION: Proliferation of HepG2
      cells can be significantly inhibited by the screened ASODN, which might be used
      as a lead compound in the development of specific CDK7 inhibitors.

TI  - The crystal structure of human CDK7 and its protein recognition properties.
PG  - 2067-79
AB  - CDK7, a member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family, regulates the
      activities of other CDKs through phosphorylation on their activation segment and 
      hence contributes to control of the eukaryotic cell cycle. CDK7 also assists in
      the regulation of transcription as part of the transcription factor TFIIH
      complex. For maximum activity and stability, CDK7 requires phosphorylation,
      association with cyclin H, and association with a third protein, MAT1. We have
      determined the crystal structure of human CDK7 in complex with ATP at 3 A
      resolution. The kinase is in the inactive conformation, similar to that observed 
      for inactive CDK2. The activation segment is phosphorylated at Thr170 and is in a
      defined conformation that differs from that in phospho-CDK2 and
      phospho-CDK2/cyclin A. The functional properties of the enzyme against CDK2 and
      CTD as substrates are characterized through kinase assays. Experiments confirm
      that CDK7 is not a substrate for kinase-associated phosphatase.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase-9: an RNAPII kinase at the nexus of cardiac growth and
      death cascades.
PG  - 867-76
AB  - Over the past decade and a half, the paradigm has emerged of cardiac hypertrophy 
      and ensuing heart failure as fundamentally a problem in signal transduction,
      impinging on the altered expression or function of gene-specific transcription
      factors and their partners, which then execute the hypertrophic phenotype.
      Strikingly, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is itself a substrate for two protein
      kinases-the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk7 and Cdk9--that are activated by
      hypertrophic cues. Phosphorylation of RNAPII in the carboxyl terminal domain
      (CTD) of its largest subunit controls a number of critical steps subsequent to
      transcription initiation, among them enabling RNAPII to overcome its stalling in 
      the promoter-proximal region and to engage in efficient transcription elongation.
      Here, we summarize our current understanding of the RNAPII-directed protein
      kinases in cardiac hypertrophy. Cdk9 activation is essential in tissue culture
      for myocyte enlargement and sufficient in transgenic mice for hypertrophy to
      occur and yet is unrelated to the "fetal" gene program that is typical of
      pathophysiological heart growth. Although this trophic effect of Cdk9 appears
      benign superficially, pathophysiological levels of Cdk9 activity render
      myocardium remarkably susceptible to apoptotic stress. Cdk9 interacts adversely
      with Gq-dependent pathways for hypertrophy, impairing the expression of numerous 
      genes for mitochondrial proteins, and, in particular, suppressing master
      regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, perioxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1), and nuclear
      respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1). Given the dual transcriptional roles of Cdk9 in
      hypertrophic growth and mitochondrial dysfunction, we suggest the potential
      usefulness of Cdk9 as a target in heart failure drug discovery.

TI  - Differential effects of allyl sulfides from garlic essential oil on cell cycle
      regulation in human liver tumor cells.
PG  - 1937-47
AB  - In this study, diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl
      trisulfide (DATS), which are major organosulfur compounds (OSCs) of garlic, were 
      used as experimental materials to investigate their modulation effects on cell
      viability and cell cycle in human liver tumor cells (J5). According to the
      results of cell viability assay, 50 or 100 microM DATS significantly decreased
      the cell viability as compared with the control (P < 0.05) in dose and time
      dependent relations. Phenomena of cell number loss, shape deformation and lysis
      were observed after treatment with 100 microM DATS for 24 h. Cell cycle studies
      showed that J5 cells were significantly arrested in G2/M phase as the cells were 
      treated with 100 microM DADS, 10, 50 or 100 microM DATS for 24 h (P < 0.05). DATS
      was more effective in arresting cells in G2/M phase than DADS, and the phenomena 
      of arresting J5 cells in G2/M phase increased obviously in dose and time
      dependent relations. According to the Western blot analysis, DATS decreased
      cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdks)-Cdk7 (i.e. Cdc2 activate kinase) protein levels in
      J5 cells but increased cyclin B1 protein level. The modulation potency to cyclin 
      B1 and Cdk7 expressions was in the order of DATS > DADS > DAS. The modulation
      potency to cyclin B1 and Cdk7 protein levels increased with increasing in DATS
      concentration and culture time. In conclusion, DATS might affect cell viability
      and cell morphological changes in J5 cells and lead cells to be arrested in G2/M 
      phase via controlling the expression of cyclin B1 and Cdk7 in J5 cells, and the
      controlling action might relate to the sulfuric atom numbers in the structures of
      all these allyl sulfides.

TI  - Selective regulation of vitamin D receptor-responsive genes by TFIIH.
PG  - 187-97
AB  - Mutations in the XPD subunit of the transcription/repair factor TFIIH cause the
      Xeroderma pigmentosum disorder. We show that in some XP-D deficient cells,
      transactivation by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is selectively inhibited for a
      subset of responsive genes, such as CYP24, and that the XPD/R683W mutation
      prevents VDR recruitment on its promoter. Contrary to other nuclear receptors,
      VDR, which lacks a functional A/B domain, is not phosphorylated and consequently 
      not regulated by the cdk7 kinase of TFIIH. In fact, we demonstrate that the VDR
      transactivation defect resides in Ets1, another activator that cannot be
      phosphorylated by TFIIH in XP-D cells. Indeed, the phosphorylated Ets1 seems to
      promote the binding of VDR to its responsive element and trigger the subsequent
      recruitment of coactivators and RNA pol II. We propose a model in which TFIIH
      regulates the activity of nuclear receptors by phosphorylating either their A/B
      domain or an additional regulatory DNA binding partner.

TI  - The plant-specific kinase CDKF;1 is involved in activating phosphorylation of
      cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinases in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2954-66
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play essential roles in coordinate control of
      cell cycle progression. Activation of CDKs requires interaction with specific
      cyclin partners and phosphorylation of their T-loops by CDK-activating kinases
      (CAKs). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes four potential CAKs. CAK2At
      (CDKD;3) and CAK4At (CDKD;2) are closely related to the vertebrate CAK,
      CDK7/p40MO15; they interact with cyclin H and phosphorylate CDKs, as well as the 
      C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. CAK1At
      (CDKF;1) shows cyclin H-independent CDK-kinase activity and can activate a
      heterologous CAK, Mcs6, in fission yeast. In Arabidopsis, CAK1At is a subunit of 
      a protein complex of 130 kD, which phosphorylates the T-loop of CAK2At and CAK4At
      and activates the CTD-kinase activity of CAK4At in vitro and in root protoplasts.
      These results suggest that CAK1At is a novel CAK-activating kinase that modulates
      the activity of CAK2At and CAK4At, thereby controlling CDK activities and basal
      transcription in Arabidopsis.

      phosphorylation.
PG  - 983-92
AB  - Phosphorylation of the Ser(118) residue in the N-terminal A/B domain of the human
      oestrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha) by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
      stimulated via growth factor signalling pathways, is known to potentiate ERalpha 
      ligand-induced transactivation function. Besides MAPK, cyclin dependent kinase 7 
      (Cdk7) in the TFIIH complex has also been found to potentiate hERalpha
      transactivation in vitro through Ser(118) phosphorylation. To investigate an
      impact of Cdk7 on hERalpha transactivation in vivo, we assessed activity of
      hERalpha in a wild-type and cdk7 inactive mutant Drosophila that ectopically
      expressed hERalpha in the eye disc. Ectopic expression of the wild-type or mutant
      receptors, together with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, allowed
      us to demonstrate that hERalpha expressed in the fly tissues was
      transcriptionally functional and adequately responded to hERalpha ligands in the 
      patterns similar to those observed in mammalian cells. Replacement of Ser(118)
      with alanine in hERalpha (S118A mutant) significantly reduced the ligand-induced 
      hERalpha transactivation function. Importantly, while in cdk7 inactive mutant
      Drosophila the wild-type hERalpha exhibited reduced response to the ligand;
      levels of transactivation by the hERalpha S118A mutant were not affected in these
      inactive cdk7 mutant flies. Furthermore, phosphorylation of hERalpha at Ser(118) 
      has been observed in vitro by both human and Drosophila Cdk7. Our findings
      demonstrate that Cdk7 is involved in regulation of the ligand-induced
      transactivation function of hERalphain vivo via Ser(118) phosphorylation.

TI  - Comparative genomics of cyclin-dependent kinases suggest co-evolution of the RNAP
      II C-terminal domain and CTD-directed CDKs.
PG  - 69
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a large family of proteins that
      function in a variety of key regulatory pathways in eukaryotic cells, including
      control over the cell cycle and gene transcription. Among the most important and 
      broadly studied of these roles is reversible phosphorylation of the C-terminal
      domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, part of a complex array of CTD/protein
      interactions that coordinate the RNAP II transcription cycle. The RNAP CTD is
      strongly conserved in some groups of eukaryotes, but highly degenerate or absent 
      in others; the reasons for these differences in stabilizing selection on CTD
      structure are not clear. Given the importance of reversible phosphorylation for
      CTD-based transcription, the distribution and evolutionary history of CDKs may be
      a key to understanding differences in constraints on CTD structure; however, the 
      origins and evolutionary relationships of CTD kinases have not been investigated 
      thoroughly. Moreover, although the functions of most CDKs are reasonably well
      studied in mammals and yeasts, very little is known from most other eukaryotes.
      RESULTS: Here we identify 123 CDK family members from animals, plants, yeasts,
      and four protists from which genome sequences have been completed, and 10
      additional CDKs from incomplete genome sequences of organisms with known CTD
      sequences. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that cell-cycle 
      CDKs are present in all organisms sampled in this study. In contrast, no clear
      orthologs of transcription-related CDKs are identified in the most putatively
      ancestral eukaryotes, Trypanosoma or Giardia. Kinases involved in CTD
      phosphorylation, CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9, all are recovered as well-supported and
      distinct orthologous families, but their relationships to each other and other
      CDKs are not well-resolved. Significantly, clear orthologs of CDK7 and CDK8 are
      restricted to only those organisms belonging to groups in which the RNAP II CTD
      is strongly conserved. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent origins of CDK7 and CDK8, or at 
      least their conservation as clearly recognizable orthologous families, correlate 
      with strong stabilizing selection on RNAP II CTD structure. This suggests
      co-evolution of the CTD and these CTD-directed CDKs. This observation is
      consistent with the hypothesis that CDK7 and CDK8 originated at about the same
      time that the CTD was canalized as the staging platform RNAP II transcription.
      Alternatively, extensive CTD phosphorylation may occur in only a subset of
      eukaryotes and, when present, this interaction results in greater stabilizing
      selection on both CTD and CDK sequences. Overall, our results suggest that
      transcription-related kinases originated after cell-cycle related CDKs, and
      became more evolutionarily and functionally diverse as transcriptional complexity
      increased.

AB  - We have established a uniform procedure for the expression and purification of
      the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK7/CycH/MAT1, CDK8/CycC and CDK9/CycT1. We attach 
      a His(6)-tag to one of the subunits of each complex and then co-express it
      together with the other subunits in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells. The CDK
      complexes are subsequently purified by Ni(2+)-NTA and Mono S chromatography. This
      approach generates large amounts of active recombinant kinases that are devoid of
      contaminating kinase activities. Importantly, the properties of these recombinant
      kinases are similar to their natural counterparts (Pinhero et al. 2004, Eur J
      Biochem 271:1004-14). Our protocol provides a novel systematic approach for the
      purification of these three (and possibly other) recombinant CDKs.

TI  - Roscovitine inhibits activation of promoters in herpes simplex virus type 1
      genomes independently of promoter-specific factors.
PG  - 9352-65
AB  - Flavopiridol, roscovitine, and other inhibitors of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDK)
      inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses in vitro while proving nontoxic
      in human clinical trials of their effects against cancer. Consequently, these and
      other Pharmacological CDK inhibitors (PCIs) have been proposed as potential
      antivirals. Flavopiridol potently inhibits all tested CDKs and inhibits the
      transcription of most cellular and viral genes. In contrast, roscovitine and
      other purine PCIs inhibit with high potency only CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK7, and 
      they specifically inhibit the expression of viral but not cellular genes. The
      levels at which purine PCIs inhibit gene expression are unknown, as are the
      factors which determine their specificity for expression of viral but not
      cellular genes. We show herein that roscovitine prevents the initiation of
      transcription of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genes but has no effect on
      transcription elongation. We further show that roscovitine does not inhibit the
      initiation or elongation of cellular transcription and that its inhibitory
      effects are specific for promoters in HSV-1 genomes. Therefore, we have
      identified a novel biological activity for PCIs, i.e., their ability to prevent
      the initiation of transcription. We have also identified genome location as one
      of the factors that determine whether the transcription of a given gene is
      inhibited by roscovitine. The activities of roscovitine on viral transcription
      resemble one of the antiherpesvirus activities of alpha interferon and could be
      used as a model for the development of novel antivirals. The genome-specific
      effects of roscovitine may also be important for its development against
      virus-induced cancers.

TI  - Pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as HIV-1 antiviral
      therapeutics.
PG  - 131-52
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can infect quiescent cells; however, 
      viral production is restricted to actively proliferating cells. Recent evidence
      has indicated that HIV-1 viral proteins, Vpr and Tat, perturb the cell cycle to
      optimize HIV-1 replication. Vpr arrests the cell cycle at G2 by inactivating the 
      cyclin B/cdk1 complex. Tat regulates the cell cycle by altering factors involved 
      in proliferation and differentiation (i.e. the cdk inhibitor p21/waf1) and
      associating with cyclin/cdk complexes (i.e. cyclin E/cdk2, cyclin H/cdk7, and
      cyclin T/cdk9). These studies indicate the importance of host cellular factors,
      such as cyclin/cdk complexes, in regulating HIV-1 replication and therefore
      represent novel targets for antiviral therapeutics. Recently, the efficacy of
      pharmalogical cdk inhibitors (PCIs) in abrogating viral replication has been
      under development. To date there are 25-30 PCIs that have been synthesized
      against known cdks, several of which have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 and other
      AIDS-associated viruses in vitro and in vivo. Targeting these critical cyclin/cdk
      complexes needed for viral propagation may solve the problems inherent in current
      HAART therapy, including the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Thus, PCIs have
      the potential to become novel therapeutic antiviral drugs that can inhibit HIV-1 
      transcription and opens the possibility of new avenues of treatment.

TI  - [Analysis of transient G1/S arrest in E1A+E1B-19kDa transformed cells after
      ionizing radiation].
PG  - 1203-10
AB  - Expression of human adenovirus type 5 E1A oncogene in normal rodent cells leads
      to disruption of the G1/S cell cycle arrest realization in response to DNA
      damage. It has been shown here that rat embryo fibroblasts transformed by E1Aad5 
      oncogene in complementation with E1B-19 kDa gene realize the irradiation-induced 
      transient G1/S arrest, which depends on selective suppression of CyclinE-Cdk2
      activity despite functional inactivation of p21Waf1 inhibitor. Inhibitor p21Waf1 
      is not revealed in complexes with cyclins E and A in E1A + E1B-19 kDa
      transformants, however, it is not due to p21Waf1 interaction with E1A
      oncoproteins, because the E1A-p21Waf1 complex formation in E1A + cHa-ras
      transformants does not prevent the high level of CycIE, A-p21Waf1 association. In
      the case of p21Waf1 inactivation, the main way of cyclin-kinase activity
      regulation in E1A + E1B-19 kDa cells may be Cdk2 phosphorylation. However,
      irradiation of E1A + E1B-19 kDa transformed cells induces no changes in CAK
      (Cdk7-associated) kinase activity and in the protein level of Cdc25A phosphatase,
      which are responsible for activating Thr160 phosphoralation and Tyr15
      dephosphorylation on Cdk2. Using phospho-Tyr15-Cdk2 specific antibodies, no
      increase of phosphorylation at Tyr15 position on immunoprecipitated Cdk2 was
      detected after irradiation. It seems likely that in the case of inactivated
      inhibitor p21Waf1 the transient G1/S block after irradiation in E1A + E1B-19 kDa 
      transformants depends on suppression of Cycl-E-Cdk2 activity caused by inhibition
      of Thr160 Cdk2 phosphorylation, but his occurs with the involvement of other
      kinases rather than CAK.

TI  - Effects of pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors on viral
      transcription and replication.
PG  - 197-209
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are required for replication of adeno-,
      papilloma- and other viruses that replicate only in dividing cells. Surprisingly,
      CDKs are also required for replication of HIV-1, HSV-1, and other viruses that
      can replicate in non-dividing cells. Since two low-molecular weight
      pharmacological CDK inhibitors (PCIs), flavopiridol (Flavo) and roscovitine
      (Rosco), appear to be non-toxic in human clinical trials against cancer, these
      drugs have been proposed as potential antiviral drugs. Rosco preferentially
      inhibits CDKs involved in cell cycle regulation (CDK1, 2, and 7) or neuronal
      functions (CDK5), whereas Flavo preferentially inhibits CDKs involved in cell
      cycle (CDK1, 2, 4, 7) or transcription (CDK7, and 9). As potential antivirals,
      PCIs display several advantages: (i) they are active against many different
      viruses, including drug-resistant strains of HIV-1 and HSV-1; (ii) PCI-resistant 
      mutants of HIV-1 or HSV-1 have not been identified; and (iii) the antiviral
      effects of PCIs and conventional antivirals appear to be additive (as expected
      from drugs that target independent pathways). Moreover, PCIs target both the
      etiological agents (i.e., the virus) and the pathogenic mechanisms (i.e.,
      unrestricted cell division) of the many diseases that include both a
      CDK-requiring virus and unrestricted cell division (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma,
      cervical carcinoma, HIV-associated nephropathy-HIVAN). This is nicely illustrated
      in a recent study which demonstrated the efficacy of Flavo in a mouse model of
      HIVAN. Herein, we will review the involvement of CDKs in viral replication and
      the antiviral properties of the most extensively characterized PCIs, with special
      emphasis on the mechanisms of inhibition of viral transcription.

TI  - Three cyclin-dependent kinases preferentially phosphorylate different parts of
      the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 1004-14
AB  - The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II plays
      critical roles in the initiation, elongation and processing of primary
      transcripts. These activities are at least partially regulated by the
      phosphorylation of the CTD by three cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs),
      namely CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9. In this study, we systematically compared the
      phosphorylation of different recombinant CTD substrates by recombinant
      CDK7/CycH/MAT1, CDK8/CycC and CDK9/CycT1 kinases. We showed that CDK7, CDK8 and
      CDK9 produce different patterns of phosphorylation of the CTD. CDK7/CycH/MAT1
      generates mostly hyperphosphorylated full-length and truncated CTD peptides,
      while CDK8/CycC and CDK9/CycT1 generate predominantly hypophosphorylated
      peptides. Total activity towards different parts of the CTD also differs between 
      the three kinases; however, these differences did not correlate with their
      ability to hyperphosphorylate the substrates. The last 10 repeats of the CTD can 
      act as a suppressor of the activity of the kinases in the context of longer
      peptides. Our results indicate that the three kinases possess different
      biochemical properties that could reflect their actions in vivo.

TI  - Roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, prevents replication of
      varicella-zoster virus.
PG  - 2853-62
AB  - Understanding the interactions between varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and host
      cells can be addressed by using small molecule inhibitors of cellular enzymes.
      Roscovitine (Rosco) is a purine derivative that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 
      1 (cdk1), cdk2, cdk5, cdk7, and cdk9, which are key regulators of the cell cycle 
      and transcription. Herpesviruses are known to interact with cell cycle proteins; 
      thus, the antiviral effects of Rosco on VZV growth were evaluated. In a plaque
      reduction assay, 25 micro M Rosco prevented VZV replication, and the antiviral
      effect was reversible for at least up to 24 h posttreatment. Rosco also reduced
      expression of the major transactivator, IE62, over 48 h. Confocal microscopy
      studies indicated that Rosco caused the immediate-early proteins ORF4 and IE62 to
      abnormally localize in infected cells and prevented cell-cell spread of VZV over 
      48 h. Rosco was found to inhibit VZV DNA synthesis as measured by real-time PCR, 
      and this technique was used to estimate the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) 
      of 14 micro M. This value was close to the EC(50) estimate of 12 micro M
      determined from plaque reduction assays. At 25 micro M, Rosco was not cytotoxic
      over 48 h in a neutral red uptake assay, and proliferation was slowed as the
      cells accumulated in a G(2)-like state. These results demonstrate the importance 
      of cdk's in VZV replication and suggest that cdk inhibitors could serve as useful
      VZV antivirals.

TI  - Phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in cardiac hypertrophy: cell enlargement
      signals converge on cyclin T/Cdk9.
PG  - 125-39
AB  - Cardiac myocyte enlargement is the eponymous characteristic of cardiac
      hypertrophy, regardless of the instigating signal. Such triggers include
      biomechanical stress (e.g., work load, compensation for ischemic damage),
      sarcomeric protein mutations, cytoskeletal protein mutations, abnormal
      energetics, G protein-coupled receptors for ligands (including angiotensin II and
      endothelin-1), or their signal transducers within cells. In turn, increased
      myocyte size reflects increased RNA and protein content per cell as responses to 
      these stimuli. In eukaryotic cells, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II
      (RNAPII) becomes extensively phosphorylated in its serine-rich C-terminal domain 
      (CTD) during the transition from transcript initiation to transcript elongation -
      that is, "escape" of RNAPII from the promoter-proximal region into the open
      reading frame. Although this process is believed to be crucial to productive
      synthesis of mRNA and is known to be governed by two atypical cyclin-dependent
      kinases, Cdk7 and Cdk9, surprisingly little is understood of how regulatory
      pathways within cells intersect these RNAPII-directed protein kinases.
      Investigations of the CTD kinase module in cardiac hypertrophy provide a
      tentative initial map of a molecular circuit controlling cell size through
      regulated phosphorylation of RNAPII.

TI  - Two cyclin-dependent kinases promote RNA polymerase II transcription and
      formation of the scaffold complex.
PG  - 1721-35
AB  - Three cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK7, -8, and -9, are specifically involved in
      transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and target the Pol II C-terminal
      domain (CTD). The role of CDK7 and CDK8 kinase activity in transcription has been
      unclear, with CDK7 shown to have variable effects on transcription and CDK8
      suggested to repress transcription and/or to target other gene-specific factors. 
      Using a chemical genetics approach, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs of
      these kinases, Kin28 and Srb10, were engineered to respond to a specific
      inhibitor and the inhibitor was used to test the role of these kinases in
      transcription in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, these kinases can both promote
      transcription, with up to 70% of transcription abolished when both kinases are
      inhibited together. Similarly, in vivo inhibition of both kinases together gives 
      the strongest decrease in transcription, as measured by chromatin
      immunoprecipitation of Pol II. Kin28 and Srb10 also have overlapping roles in
      promoting ATP-dependent dissociation of the preinitiation complex (PIC) into the 
      Scaffold complex. Using the engineered kinases and an ATP analog, specific kinase
      substrates within the PIC were identified. In addition to the previously known
      substrate, the Pol II CTD, it was found that Kin28 phosphorylates two subunits of
      Mediator and Srb10 targets two subunits of TFIID for phosphorylation.

TI  - The Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CYC202 (R-roscovitine) inhibits
      retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, causes loss of Cyclin D1, and activates
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
PG  - 262-72
AB  - Deregulation of the cell cycle commonly occurs during tumorigenesis, resulting in
      unrestricted cell proliferation and independence from mitogens. Cyclin-dependent 
      kinase inhibitors have the potential to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
      cancer cells. CYC202 (R-roscovitine) is a potent inhibitor of CDK2/cyclin E that 
      is undergoing clinical trials. Drugs selected to act on a particular molecular
      target may exert additional or alternative effects in intact cells. We therefore 
      studied the molecular pharmacology of CYC202 in human colon cancer cells.
      Treatment of HT29 and KM12 colon carcinoma cell lines with CYC202 decreased both 
      retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and total retinoblastoma protein. In
      addition, an increase in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated
      kinases 1/2 was observed. As a result, downstream activation of the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway occurred, as demonstrated by an increase
      in ELK-1 phosphorylation and in c-FOS expression. Use of mitogen-activated
      protein kinase kinases 1/2 inhibitors showed that the CYC202-induced
      extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 phosphorylation was mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase kinases 1/2 dependent but did not contribute to the cell cycle
      effects of the drug, which included a reduction of cells in G(1), inhibition of
      bromodeoxyuridine incorporation during S-phase, and a moderate increase in G(2)-M
      phase. Despite activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, cyclin
      D1 protein levels were decreased by CYC202, an effect that occurred
      simultaneously with loss of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and inhibition
      of cell cycle progression. The reduced expression of cyclin D1 protein was
      independent of the p38(SAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, which
      are known regulators of cyclin D1 protein. Interestingly, CYC202 caused a clear
      reduction in cyclins D1, A, and B1 mRNA, whereas c-FOS mRNA increased by 2-fold. 
      This was accompanied by a loss of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and total RNA
      polymerase II protein, suggesting that CYC202 was inhibiting transcription,
      possibly via inhibition of CDK7 and CDK9 complexes. It can be concluded that
      although CYC202 can act as a CDK2 inhibitor, it also has the potential to inhibit
      CDK4 and CDK1 activities in cancer cells through the down-regulation of the
      corresponding cyclin partners. This provides a possible mechanism by which CYC202
      can cause a reduction in retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation at multiple sites
      and cell cycle arrest in G(1), S, and G(2)-M phases. In addition to providing
      useful insights into the molecular pharmacology of CYC202 in human cancer cells, 
      the results also suggest potential pharmacodynamic end points for use in clinical
      trials with the drug.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus core functions as a suppressor of cyclin-dependent
      kinase-activating kinase and impairs cell cycle progression.
PG  - 11719-26
AB  - We investigated how the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein affects the cell
      cycle profile and cell cycle-related molecules by using the HCV core-expressing
      stable transfectant. Analysis of the cell cycle profile showed that HCV core
      impaired G(1) to S transition. The E2F-mediated transcription, phosphorylation of
      the retinoblastoma protein, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK2
      activities were suppressed in HCV core-expressing cells. The expression levels of
      G(1) phase-related CDKs/cyclins and various CDK inhibitors were not substantially
      affected by expression of HCV core. When influences of HCV core on CDK-activating
      kinase (CAK) were examined, the expression levels of the CAK components, CDK7,
      cyclin H, and MAT1, were not affected. However, formation of the ternary CAK
      complex, CAK activity, and the CDK2 level with activating phosphorylation were
      inhibited by expression of the HCV core. The direct effect of HCV core on CAK was
      further assessed in the cell-free system by adding the in vitro translated HCV
      core protein to the anti-CDK7 immunoprecipitate from the cell. The results showed
      that HCV core led to dissociation of MAT1 from the CAK complex and suppressed the
      CAK activity. Furthermore, the binding assay revealed that the HCV core was
      directed against CDK7. Their interaction occurred mainly in the nucleus by the
      immunostaining. In conclusion, the HCV core protein interacts with CAK and
      functions as an extrinsic suppressor of CAK. This may be the molecular basis of
      HCV core-mediated suppression of cell cycle progression. Our findings suggest a
      novel mechanism concerning HCV core-mediated alteration in the cell cycle
      machinery.

TI  - Current researches on breast cancer epidemiology in Korea.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - As a cause of death in women, breast cancer ranks second to stomach cancer in
      Korea. Age-standardized mortality rates for breast cancer steadily increased
      during the 1980s and 1990s. There are big differences in the incidence rates for 
      breast cancer compared with Western countries. Epidemiological features, trends
      in morbidity and mortality, various age-specific incidence curves, migrant study 
      results, and analysis of the risk factors, however, suggest that the incidence of
      breast cancer might be further increasing in Korea. The key epidemiological
      hormonal risk factors for breast cancer are all explicable in terms of the
      estrogen augmented by progesterone hypothesis. These include older age, family
      history of breast cancer, early menarche, late menopause, late full-term
      pregnancy, and never a breast feeding. Both the establishment of high-risk groups
      and the estimation of lifetime risk are essential to develop a control strategy
      against breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common histologic
      type of breast cancer in Korea, and the five-year survival rate has been
      estimated as 80-83%. Recent studies on the identification of susceptibility
      factors such as genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1/T1/P1, COMT, CYP2E1, CYP19, CYP17,
      ER-alpha, XRCC1, XRCC3, RAD52, TGF-alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-1B, IL-1RN, CDK7 etc.
      that predispose individuals to breast cancer by gene-environment or gene-gene
      interactions may possibly give further insight into both the etiology and the
      prevention of this malignancy.

TI  - p42, a novel cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase in mammalian cells.
PG  - 4507-14
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) phosphorylates a
      conserved threonine residue on CDKs and activates them. Two known classes of CAKs
      are represented by monomeric Cak1p in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 
      by heterotrimeric CDK7-cyclin H-Mat1 in human and other metazoa. We report here
      the identification of p42, a novel CAK activity in human cells. p42 has sequence 
      homology to both Cak1p and CDK7 groups of CAKs. p42 is essential for the
      phosphorylation of Thr-160 and activation of CDK2. A dominant-negative p42
      mutant, T161A, and posttranscriptional gene silencing of p42 with RNA(i)-impaired
      Thr-160 phosphorylation and activity of CDK2. Purified p42 phosphorylated
      glutathione S-transferase-CDK2 at Thr-160 within the T-loop and activated its
      histone H1 kinase activity. Finally, p42 is indispensable for cell growth. Cells 
      lacking p42 were incapable of growing and forming colonies whereas cells with a
      reduced level of p42 grew at significantly slower rates than control cells. Our
      findings suggest that p42 represents a novel CAK activity in mammalian cells.

TI  - Cdk7 functions as a cdk5 activating kinase in brain.
PG  - 285-96
AB  - Activity of Cdk5, which is essential for CNS development, depends on its
      association with p35 (or truncated p25) or p39, but the regulatory mechanisms
      whereby Cdk5 is activated have not yet been fully elucidated. Studies on PC12
      cells showed that Cdk5/p25 activity is modulated by an unidentified kinase that
      phosphorylates Cdk5 at Ser159 and enhances its kinase activity (Sharma et al.,
      1999 PNAS USA 96,11156). In this study, we have partially purified a bovine brain
      enzyme that can phosphorylate the Cdk5(149-163) peptide but not the
      Cdk5(149-163)A159 peptide. The enzyme, which contains Cdk7, cyclin H, and Mat1,
      specifically phosphorylates Ser159 of Cdk5(149-163) and enhances Cdk5/p25
      activity. The active Cdk7-containing enzyme also phosphorylates and activates wt 
      Cdk5 but not mutated Cdk5(Ser159Ala). Likewise, Cdk7 or cyclin H
      immunoprecipitate from mouse brain specifically phosphorylates wt Cdk5 at Ser159 
      and enhances Cdk5/p25 activity. Conversely, blocked Cdk7 immunoprecipitate does
      not phosphorylate nor activate Cdk5. In addition, the Cdk7 substrate, CTD of
      RNAPII, causes a dose-dependent decline in Cdk5 activation by Cdk7. These
      findings indicate that Cdk7 functions as a Cdk5 activating kinase in brain.
      Indeed, elevated Cdk5 activity in the developing E18 mouse brain coincides with
      increased Cdk7 kinase activity.

TI  - CIITA regulates transcription onset viaSer5-phosphorylation of RNA Pol II.
PG  - 5125-36
AB  - We describe the temporal order of recruitment of transcription factors, cofactors
      and basal transcriptional components and the consequent biochemical events that
      lead to activation of the major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) DRA gene
      transcription by IFN-gamma. We found that the gene is 'poised' for activation
      since both the activators and a fraction of the basal transcriptional machinery
      are pre-assembled at the enhancer and promoter prior to IFN-gamma treatment. The 
      class II transactivator is synthesized following IFN-gamma treatment and it is
      recruited to the enhanceosome leading to the subsequent recruitment of the CBP
      and GCN5 coactivators. This is followed by histone acetylation and recruitment of
      the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. CIITA also recruits the CDK7 and CDK9
      kinases and enhances the ability of CDK7 to phosphorylate Pol II at Ser5 leading 
      to initiation of mRNA synthesis. Thus, the gene-specific class II transactivator 
      selects the target genes for expression by coordinating a multiple set of
      biochemical activities ranging from chromatin alterations and pre-initiation
      complex assembly to promoter clearance.

TI  - Cdk7 is required for full activation of Drosophila heat shock genes and RNA
      polymerase II phosphorylation in vivo.
PG  - 6876-86
AB  - TFIIH has been implicated in several fundamental cellular processes, including
      DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and transcription. In transcription, the
      helicase activity of TFIIH functions to melt promoter DNA; however, the in vivo
      function of the Cdk7 kinase subunit of TFIIH, which has been hypothesized to be
      involved in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylation, is not clearly
      understood. Using temperature-sensitive and null alleles of cdk7, we have
      examined the role of Cdk7 in the activation of Drosophila heat shock genes.
      Several in vivo approaches, including polytene chromosome immunofluorescence,
      nuclear run-on assays, and, in particular, a protein-DNA cross-linking assay
      customized for adults, revealed that Cdk7 kinase activity is required for full
      activation of heat shock genes, promoter-proximal Pol II pausing, and Pol
      II-dependent chromatin decondensation. The requirement for Cdk7 occurs very early
      in the transcription cycle. Furthermore, we provide evidence that TFIIH
      associates with the elongation complex much longer than previously suspected.

TI  - Xpd/Ercc2 regulates CAK activity and mitotic progression.
PG  - 228-32
AB  - General transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) consists of nine subunits:
      cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7), cyclin H and MAT1 (forming the
      Cdk-activating-kinase or CAK complex), the two helicases Xpb/Hay and Xpd, and
      p34, p44, p52 and p62 (refs 1-3). As the kinase subunit of TFIIH, Cdk7
      participates in basal transcription by phosphorylating the carboxy-terminal
      domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. As part of CAK, Cdk7 also
      phosphorylates other Cdks, an essential step for their activation. Here we show
      that the Drosophila TFIIH component Xpd negatively regulates the cell cycle
      function of Cdk7, the CAK activity. Excess Xpd titrates CAK activity, resulting
      in decreased Cdk T-loop phosphorylation, mitotic defects and lethality, whereas a
      decrease in Xpd results in increased CAK activity and cell proliferation.
      Moreover, Xpd is downregulated at the beginning of mitosis when Cdk1, a cell
      cycle target of Cdk7, is most active. Downregulation of Xpd thus seems to
      contribute to the upregulation of mitotic CAK activity and to regulate mitotic
      progression positively. Simultaneously, the downregulation of Xpd might be a
      major mechanism of mitotic silencing of basal transcription.

TI  - The histidine triad protein Hint is not required for murine development or Cdk7
      function.
PG  - 3929-35
AB  - The histidine triad (HIT) protein Hint has been found to associate with mammalian
      Cdk7, as well as to interact both physically and genetically with the budding
      yeast Cdk7 homologue Kin28. To study the function of Hint and to explore its
      possible role in modulating Cdk7 activity in vivo, we have characterized the
      expression pattern of murine Hint and generated Hint-deficient (Hint(-/-)) mice. 
      Hint was widely expressed during mouse development, with pronounced expression in
      several neuronal ganglia, epithelia, hearts, and testes from embryonic day 15
      onward. Despite this widespread expression, disruption of Hint did not impair
      murine development. Moreover, Hint-deficient mice had a normal life span and were
      apparently healthy. Histological examination of tissues with high Hint expression
      in wild-type animals did not show signs of abnormal pathology in Hint(-/-) mice. 
      Functional redundancy within the HIT family was addressed by crossing Hint(-/-)
      mice with mice lacking the related HIT protein, Fhit, and by assaying the
      expression levels of the HIT protein gene family members Hint2 and Hint3 in
      Hint(+/+) and Hint(-/-) tissues. Finally, Cdk7 kinase activity and cell cycle
      kinetics were found to be comparable in wild-type and Hint(-/-) mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts, suggesting that Hint may not be a key regulator of Cdk7 activity.

TI  - Cyclins that don't cycle--cyclin T/cyclin-dependent kinase-9 determines cardiac
      muscle cell size.
PG  - 99-104
AB  - A subset of cyclin-dependent protein kinases--Cdk7, Cdk8, and Cdk9--participates 
      directly, in complex ways, with the fundamental machinery for gene transcription,
      as elements of general transcription factors whose substrate is the C-terminal
      domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Here, we review recent data implicating the
      CTD kinase Cdk9 as a critical determinant of cardiac hypertrophy, in vitro and in
      vivo. Diverse trophic signals that increase cardiac mass all activated Cdk9 (work
      load, the small G-protein Gaq, and the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin 
      in mouse myocardium; endothelin-1, a hypertrophic agonist, in cultured
      cardiomyocytes). Little or no change occurred in levels of the kinase or its
      activator, cyclin T. Instead, in all four hypertrophic models, Cdk9 activation
      involves the dissociation of 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA), an endogenous
      inhibitor. In culture, dominant-negative Cdk9 blocked ET-1-induced hypertrophy,
      whereas an anti-sense "knockdown" of 7SK snRNA provoked spontaneous cell growth. 
      In trans-genie mice, concordant with these results, activation of Cdk9 activity
      via cardiac-specific overexpression of cyclin Tl suffices to provoke hypertrophy.
      Together, these findings implicate Cdk9 activity as a pivotal regulator of
      pathophysiological heart growth. Because hypertrophy, in turn, is a cardinal risk
      factor for developing cardiac pump failure, these results support the logic of
      examining Cdk9 as a potential drug target in heart disease.

TI  - Resveratrol-induced G2 arrest through the inhibition of CDK7 and p34CDC2 kinases 
      in colon carcinoma HT29 cells.
PG  - 1053-60
AB  - Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a phytoalexin found in grapes and other 
      food products, has been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity. However,
      the mechanism of the anti-carcinogenic activity is not well understood. Here, we 
      offer a possible explanation of its anti-tumor effect. Based on flow cytometric
      analysis, resveratrol inhibited the proliferation of HT29 colon cancer cells and 
      resulted in their accumulation in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle. Western blot 
      analysis and kinase assays demonstrated that the perturbation of G(2) phase
      progression by resveratrol was accompanied by the inactivation of p34(CDC2)
      protein kinase, and an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylated (inactive) form of
      p34(CDC2). Kinase assays revealed that the reduction of p34(CDC2) activity by
      resveratrol was mediated through the inhibition of CDK7 kinase activity, while
      CDC25A phosphatase activity was not affected. In addition, resveratrol-treated
      cells were shown to have a low level of CDK7 kinase-Thr(161)-phosphorylated
      p34(CDC2). These results demonstrated that resveratrol induced cell cycle arrest 
      at the G(2) phase through the inhibition of CDK7 kinase activity, suggesting that
      its anti-tumor activity might occur through the disruption of cell division at
      the G(2)/M phase.

TI  - Characterization of gastrin-induced cytostatic effect on cell proliferation in
      experimental malignant gliomas.
PG  - 881-90; discussion 890-1
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Growth patterns of astrocytic tumors can be modulated in vitro by
      gastrin. In this study, the influence of gastrin on the in vitro cell cycle
      kinetics and the in vivo growth features of three experimental malignant gliomas 
      was investigated. METHODS: Gastrin-induced influence on overall growth was
      assayed in vitro by means of the
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium colorimetric assay for human
      U373 and rat C6 gliomas and for rat 9L gliosarcoma. Although cell cycle analyses 
      were performed by means of computer-assisted microscope analyses of
      Feulgen-stained nuclei, the gastrin-induced effects of the levels of expression
      of cyclins D3 and E, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK7, p15, p16, E2F1, and E2F2 were
      assayed by means of quantitative Western blot test. The presence of ribonucleic
      acids for the CCK(B) and CCK(C) gastrin receptors in the U373, C6, and 9L models 
      was assayed by means of quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
      reaction, and the presence or absence of ribonucleic acids for CCK(A) receptor
      was checked by means of conventional polymerase chain reaction. The influence of 
      gastrin was also characterized in vivo in terms of the survival periods of
      conventional rats orthotopically grafted with the C6 and 9L models and nude rats 
      with the U373 model. RESULTS: Gastrin significantly decreased the overall growth 
      rate in the rat C6 and the human U373 high-grade astrocytic tumor models with
      either CCK(B) or CCK(C) gastrin receptor but not in the 9L rat gliosarcoma, which
      had no CCK(B) gastrin receptor (but had CCK(A) receptor) and only weak amounts of
      CCK(C) receptor. This effect seems to occur via a cytostatic effect; that is, an 
      accumulation of tumor astrocytes occurs in the G(1) cell cycle phase. The
      cytostatic effect could relate to a gastrin-induced decrease in the amounts of
      the cyclin D3-CDK4 complex in both C6 and U373 glioma cells. In vivo, gastrin
      significantly increased the survival periods of C6 and U373 glioma-bearing rats, 
      but not of 9L gliosarcoma-bearing rats. CONCLUSION: Gastrin is able to
      significantly modify the growth levels of a number of experimental gliomas.

TI  - Feminizing chicks: a model for avian sex determination based on titration of Hint
      enzyme activity and the predicted structure of an Asw-Hint heterodimer.
PG  - R18
AB  - BACKGROUND: In birds and some lizards, females are heterogametic with a ZW
      karyotype, while males are ZZ homogametes. The molecular basis for sexual
      differentiation in birds is unknown: arguments exist for doses of Z masculinizing
      chicks and for W information feminizing. ASW was identified as a tandemly
      repeated gene conserved on avian W chromosomes that is expressed in early female 
      development and appears to be an inactive form of avian Z-encoded HINT. Hint is a
      dimeric enzyme that hydrolyzes AMP linked to lysine, whose enzyme activity is
      required for regulation of the Cdk7 homologous Kin28 kinase in yeast. Of 16
      residues most conserved across all life forms for AMP interactions, 15 are
      sexually dimorphic in birds, that is, altered in the female-specific Asw protein.
      Genomic and expression data suggest that Asw may feminize chicks, dominantly
      interfering with Hint function by heterodimerization. RESULTS: We consider
      whether positive cooperativity could explain how Hint heterodimerization with an 
      inert enzyme might reduce specific activity by more than 50% and provide data
      sufficient to reject this model. Instead, we hypothesize that Asw carries a
      signal for mislocalization and/or proteolysis, and/or dominantly suppresses the
      remaining Hint active site to function as a dominant negative. CONCLUSIONS:
      Molecular modeling suggests that Asw and Hint can heterodimerize and that Gln
      127, an Asw-specific alteration for Trp123, dominantly interferes with the Hint
      active site. An extra dose of HINT in ZZW chicks, and thus more Hint homodimer,
      may partially overcome the feminizing influence of ASW and lead to the observed
      intersexual characteristics of ZZW triploids.

TI  - Nuclear receptors: integration of multiple signalling pathways through
      phosphorylation.
PG  - 355-66
AB  - Nuclear receptors (NRs) orchestrate the transcription of specific gene networks
      in response to binding of their cognate ligand. They also act as mediators in a
      variety of signalling pathways through integrating diverse phosphorylation
      events. NR phosphorylation concerns all three major domains, the N-terminal
      activation function (AF-1), the ligand-binding and the DNA binding domains.
      Often, phosphorylation of NRs by kinases that are associated with general
      transcription factors (e.g. cdk7 within TFIIH), or activated in response to a
      variety of signals (MAPKs, Akt, PKA, PKC), facilitates the recruitment of
      coactivators or of components of the transcription machinery and, therefore,
      cooperates with the ligand to enhance transcription activation. But
      phosphorylation can also contribute to the termination of the ligand response
      through inducing DNA dissociation or NR degradation or through decreasing ligand 
      affinity. These different modes of regulation reveal an unexpected complexity of 
      the dynamics of NR-mediated transcription. In addition, deregulation of NR
      phosphorylation may impact their action in certain diseases or cancers.

TI  - Two forms of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme display different abundance during the 
      cell cycle.
PG  - 484-8
AB  - We analyzed the composition and abundance of two forms of RNA polymerase II (pol 
      II) holoenzyme in synchronized HeLa cells. We did not detect significant changes 
      in pol II holoenzyme composition, but we noticed differences in the abundance of 
      the two complexes at different stages of the cell cycle. Summarized data from
      several independent experiments demonstrate that pol II holoenzyme, which is
      purified by GST-TFIIS affinity chromatography, is more abundant during G1/S and S
      phases. Another form of pol II holoenzyme, which is purified by anti-CDK7
      antibodies, shows relatively higher amounts in G2/M and early G1 phases.

TI  - Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases: comparative study of hepatocellular
      carcinoma versus cirrhosis.
PG  - 534-43
AB  - Increasing evidence has indicated that perturbation of cyclins is one of the
      major factors leading to cancer. The aim of this study was not only to
      investigate various cell cycle-related kinase activities in hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), but also to analyze the difference of cell cycle-related kinase 
      activity levels between hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced HCC and HCV-induced
      cirrhosis. The protein levels of cyclins D1, E, A, and H, and of cyclin dependent
      kinase 1 (Cdk1), Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdk7 in HCC and in surrounding nontumorous
      cirrhosis were determined by Western blot. The enzymatic activities of cyclins
      D1, E, A, Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdk7, and Wee1 were measured using in vitro kinase
      assays. Protein levels and kinase activities of cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin E, cyclin
      A, and Wee1 were significantly elevated in HCC compared with surrounding
      cirrhotic tissues. The enhanced cyclin D1-related kinase activity in HCC was
      accompanied by the up-regulation of Cdk4 activity, but not Cdk6 activity. The
      kinase activities of Cdk6, Cdk7, and Cdk1 did not differ between HCC and
      surrounding cirrhotic tissues. In addition, the protein levels and kinase
      activities of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and cyclin E were higher in poorly differentiated 
      HCC and advanced HCC. In conclusion, the increases of cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin E, 
      cyclin A, and Wee1 play an important role in the development of HCC from
      cirrhosis. Cyclin D1, Cdk4, and cyclin E activation may be closely related to the
      histopathologic grade and progression of HCC.

TI  - The growth factor granulin interacts with cyclin T1 and modulates
      P-TEFb-dependent transcription.
PG  - 1688-702
AB  - Cyclin T1, together with the kinase CDK9, is a component of the transcription
      elongation factor P-TEFb which binds the human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      (HIV-1) transactivator Tat. P-TEFb facilitates transcription by phosphorylating
      the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Cyclin T1 is an
      exceptionally large cyclin and is therefore a candidate for interactions with
      regulatory proteins. We identified granulin as a cyclin T1-interacting protein
      that represses expression from the HIV-1 promoter in transfected cells. The
      granulins, mitogenic growth factors containing repeats of a cysteine-rich motif, 
      were reported previously to interact with Tat. We show that granulin formed
      stable complexes in vivo and in vitro with cyclin T1 and Tat. Granulin bound to
      the histidine-rich domain of cyclin T1, which was recently found to bind to the
      CTD, but not to cyclin T2. Binding of granulin to P-TEFb inhibited the
      phosphorylation of a CTD peptide. Granulin expression inhibited Tat
      transactivation, and tethering experiments showed that this effect was due, at
      least in part, to a direct action on cyclin T1 in the absence of Tat. In
      addition, granulin was a substrate for CDK9 but not for the other
      transcription-related kinases CDK7 and CDK8. Thus, granulin is a cellular protein
      that interacts with cyclin T1 to inhibit transcription.

TI  - Differential phosphorylation activities of CDK-activating kinases in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana.
PG  - 69-74
AB  - Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) requires phosphorylation of a
      threonine residue within the T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Here we
      isolated an Arabidopsis cDNA (CAK4At) whose predicted product shows a high
      similarity to vertebrate CDK7/p40(MO15). Northern blot analysis showed that
      expressions of the four Arabidopsis CAKs (CAK1At-CAK4At) were not dependent on
      cell division. CAK2At- and CAK4At-immunoprecipitates of Arabidopsis crude extract
      phosphorylated CDK and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit
      of RNA polymerase II with different preferences. These results suggest the
      existence of differential mechanisms in Arabidopsis that control CDK and CTD
      phosphorylation by multiple CAKs.

TI  - Inhibition of cdk2 activating phosphorylation by mevastatin.
PG  - 4840-6
AB  - Phosphorylation of cdk2 on threonine 160 is essential for kinase activity.
      Mevastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, inhibits cell growth through
      inhibition of cdk2 and this has been suggested to be due to enhancement of p21
      levels. In a prostate cancer cell line, PC3, mevastatin treatment led to elevated
      levels of p21 and caused a small increase in the p21 associated with cdk2.
      However, this increase in the associated p21 appeared out of proportion with the 
      resulting dramatic inhibition of kinase activity. Using RNA interference we show 
      that mevastatin inhibits cdk2 activity despite lack of induction of p21, p27, and
      p57. Instead the kinase was inhibited due to a decrease in activating
      phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of cdk2 from mevastatin-treated cells with
      exogenous cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-activating enzymes restored its
      functional activity. The only known mammalian cyclin H.cdk7.mat1 complex
      (cdk2-activating kinase, Cak), was not inhibited by mevastatin, suggesting either
      that a different CAK is responsible for cdk2 phosphorylation in vivo or that the 
      regulation is at the level of substrate accessibility or of cdk2
      dephosphorylation. These results suggest that mevastatin inhibits cdk2 activity
      in PC3 cells through the inhibition of Thr-160 phosphorylation of cdk2, providing
      a novel example of regulation of cdk2 at this level.

TI  - Functional coupling of capping and transcription of mRNA.
PG  - 599-609
AB  - In humans, 5' m(7)G cap addition is accomplished cotranscriptionally by the
      sequential action of the capping enzyme (Hce1) and the cap methyltransferase
      (Hcm1). We found that guanylylation and methylation occur efficiently during
      transcription with t(1/2)'s of less than 15 and 70 s, respectively. A two to four
      order of magnitude increase was found in the rate of guanylylation of RNA in
      transcription complexes compared to free RNA. This stimulation required only the 
      RNA polymerase II elongation complex and Hce1. Capping activity was weakly
      associated with elongation but not preinitiation complexes. The CTD was not
      required for functional coupling but stimulated the rate of capping 4-fold.
      Inhibition of Cdk7 but not Cdk9 similarly slowed the rate of capping.

TI  - A phosphorylation defective retinoic acid receptor mutant mimics the effects of
      retinoic acid on EGFR mediated AP-1 expression and cancer cell proliferation.
PG  - 15
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) are
      mediated at the transcriptional level by retinoic acid receptors (RAR). These
      proteins are part of a superfamily of transcription factors which activate target
      gene expression when bound to their respective ligands. In addition to ligand
      binding, heterodimerization with transcriptional cofactors and posttranslational 
      modification such as phosphorylation are also critical for transactivation
      function. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of a serine residue at
      amino acid 77 in the RARalpha amino terminus was required for basal activation
      function of the transcription factor. RESULTS: We have determined that RA
      inhibits cyclin H and cdk7 expression thereby decreasing levels of phosphorylated
      RARalpha in human cancer cell lines. To determine the effects of decreased
      RARalpha phosphorylation in human cancer cells, we stably transfected a
      phosphorylation defective mutant RARalpha expression construct into SCC25
      cultures. Cells expressing the mutant RARalpha proliferated more slowly than
      control clones. This decreased proliferation was associated with increased cyclin
      dependent kinase inhibitor expression and decreased S phase entry. In the absence
      of ligand, the RARalpha mutant inhibited AP-1 activity to an extent similar to
      that of RA treated control clones. Levels of some AP-1 proteins were inhibited
      due to decreased EGFR expression upstream in the signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results indicate that hypophosphorylated RARalpha can mimic the anti-AP-1
      effects of RA in the absence of ligand.

TI  - Transcription factor TFIIH components enhance the GR coactivator activity but not
      the cell cycle-arresting activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1
      protein Vpr.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-accessory protein Vpr interacts
      with and potentiates the activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and arrests
      the host cell cycle at the G2/M boundary. Here we report that three core
      components of the general transcription factor (TF) IIH, CDK7, Cyclin H, and
      MAT1, enhance Vpr's GR coactivator activity but inhibit its cell cycle-arresting 
      function. A CDK7 mutant defective in kinase activity for the C-terminal tail of
      RNA polymerase II, which cannot form a functional TFIIH complex, did not enhance 
      Vpr coactivator activity. Overexpression of all three TFIIH components and p300
      cooperatively enhanced Vpr coactivator activity, whereas TFIIH overexpression did
      not potentiate the transcriptional activity of a Vpr mutant, which does not bind 
      p300/CBP. These findings suggest that TFIIH participates in Vpr's GR coactivating
      activity, at a step beyond its interaction with p300/CBP.

TI  - Activation and function of cyclin T-Cdk9 (positive transcription elongation
      factor-b) in cardiac muscle-cell hypertrophy.
PG  - 1310-7
AB  - Hypertrophic growth is a risk factor for mortality in heart diseases. Mechanisms 
      are lacking for this global increase in RNA and protein per cell, which underlies
      hypertrophy. Hypertrophic signals cause phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II 
      C-terminal domain, required for transcript elongation. RNA polymerase II kinases 
      include cyclin-dependent kinases-7 (Cdk7) and Cdk9, components of two basal
      transcription factors. We report activation of Cdk7 and -9 in hypertrophy
      triggered by signaling proteins (Galphaq, calcineurin) or chronic mechanical
      stress. Only Cdk9 was activated by acute load or, in culture, by endothelin. A
      preferential role for Cdk9 was shown in RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and
      growth induced by endothelin, using pharmacological and dominant-negative
      inhibitors. All four hypertrophic signals dissociated 7SK small nuclear RNA, an
      endogenous inhibitor, from cyclin T-Cdk9. Cdk9 was limiting for cardiac growth,
      shown by suppressing its inhibitor (7SK) in culture and preventing downregulation
      of its activator (cyclin T1) in mouse myocardium.Note: In the AOP version of this
      article, the numbering of the author affiliations was incorrect. This has now

TI  - DNA repair and transcriptional effects of mutations in TFIIH in Drosophila
      development.
PG  - 3246-56
AB  - Mutations in XPB and XPD TFIIH helicases have been related with three hereditary 
      human disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and
      trichothiodystrophy. The dual role of TFIIH in DNA repair and transcription makes
      it difficult to discern which of the mutant TFIIH phenotypes is due to defects in
      any of these different processes. We used haywire (hay), the Drosophila XPB
      homolog, to dissect this problem. Our results show that when hay dosage is
      affected, the fly shows defects in structures that require high levels of
      transcription. We found a genetic interaction between hay and cdk7, and we
      propose that some of these phenotypes are due to transcriptional deficiencies. We
      also found more apoptotic cells in imaginal discs and in the CNS of hay mutant
      flies than in wild-type flies. Because this abnormal level of apoptosis was not
      detected in cdk7 flies, this phenotype could be related to defects in DNA repair.
      In addition the apoptosis induced by p53 Drosophila homolog (Dmp53) is suppressed
      in heterozygous hay flies.

TI  - Protein phosphatase-1 dephosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA
      polymerase-II.
PG  - 40442-8
AB  - Transcription by RNA polymerase-II (RNAPII) is controlled by multisite
      phosphorylation of the heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the
      largest subunit. Phosphorylation of CTD is mediated by the cyclin-dependent
      protein kinases Cdk7 and Cdk9, whereas protein serine/threonine phosphatase FCP1 
      dephosphorylates CTD. We have recently reported that human immunodeficiency
      virus-1 (HIV-1) transcription is positively regulated by protein phosphatase-1
      (PP1) and that PP1 dephosphorylates recombinant CTD. Here, we provide further
      evidence that PP1 can dephosphorylate RNAPII CTD. In vitro, PP1 dephosphorylated 
      recombinant CTD as well as purified RNAPII CTD. HeLa nuclear extracts were found 
      to contain a species of PP1 that dephosphorylates both serine 2 and serine 5 of
      the heptapeptide repeats. In nuclear extracts, PP1 and FCP1 contributed roughly
      equally to the dephosphorylation of serine 2. PP1 co-purified with RNAPII by gel 
      filtration and associated with RNAPII on immunoaffinity columns prepared with
      anti-CTD antibodies. In cultured cells treated with CTD kinase inhibitors, the
      dephosphorylation of RNAPII on serine 2 was inhibited by 45% by preincubation
      with okadaic acid, which inhibits phosphatases of PPP family, including PP1 but
      not FCP1. Our data demonstrate that RNAPII CTD is dephosphorylated by PP1 in
      vitro and by PPP-type phosphatase, distinct from FCP1, in vivo.

TI  - Mutations in the RING domain of TFB3, a subunit of yeast transcription factor
      IIH, reveal a role in cell cycle progression.
PG  - 39409-16
AB  - The RNA polymerase II general transcription factor TFIIH is composed of 9 known
      subunits and possesses DNA helicase and protein kinase activities. The kinase
      subunits of TFIIH in animal cells, Cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1, were independently
      isolated as an activity termed CAK (Cdk-activating kinase), which phosphorylates 
      and activates cell cycle kinases. However, CAK activity of TFIIH subunits could
      not be demonstrated in budding yeast. TFB3, the 38-kDa subunit of yeast TFIIH, is
      the homolog of mammalian MAT1. By random mutagenesis we have isolated a
      temperature-sensitive mutation in the conserved RING domain. The mutant Tfb3
      protein associates less efficiently with the kinase moiety of TFIIH than the wild
      type protein. In contrast to lethal mutants in other subunits of TFIIH, this
      mutation does not impair general transcription. Transcription of CLB2, and
      possibly other genes, is reduced in the mutant. At the restrictive temperature,
      the cells display a defect in cell cycle progression, which is manifest at more
      than one phase of the cycle. To conclude, in the present study we bring another
      demonstration of the multifunctional nature of TFIIH.

TI  - MBLR, a new RING finger protein resembling mammalian Polycomb gene products, is
      regulated by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation.
PG  - 835-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: The RING finger proteins function in a variety of fundamental
      cellular processes. The products of some members of the Polycomb group (PcG) bear
      ring finger domains and are defined as a subclass of RING finger proteins. Among 
      them are Drosophila posterior sex combs and suppressor 2 of zeste, whose RING
      fingers are conserved in vertebrate PcG proteins Mel18 and Bmi1. RESULTS: We have
      identified a new mammalian RING finger protein, termed MBLR due to its structural
      similarity to Mel18 and Bmi1 (Mel18 and Bmi1-like RING finger protein). MBLR
      interacts with some PcG proteins: in vitro biochemical data support the idea of a
      direct interaction of MBLR's RING finger domain with Ring1B, which is highly
      homologous to one of the mammalian PcG genes, Ring1A. We also show that MBLR acts
      as a transcriptional repressor in transiently transfected cells, as is the case
      for other PcG proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis reveals that MBLR protein is 
      localized in a fine-grained distribution throughout the nucleoplasm in interphase
      cultured cells and in a fainter diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in mitotic
      cells. In addition, we find that serine 32 of MBLR is specifically phosphorylated
      during mitosis, most likely by CDK7, a component of the basal transcriptional
      machinery. CONCLUSION: Similarities to previously defined PcG proteins suggest
      that MBLR should be included in the same subclass of RING finger proteins as
      Mel18 and Bmi1. Although the biological relevance of the cell cycle-related
      phosphorylation remains to be demonstrated, serine 32 phosphorylation could
      nevertheless be functionally important.

TI  - Cyclin H is a new binding partner for protein kinase CK2.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - The protein kinase CK2 holoenzyme is composed of two regulatory beta- and two
      catalytic alpha- or alpha(')-subunits. There is ample evidence for the binding of
      individual subunits of CK2 to various cellular proteins and, moreover, for
      functions of the individual subunits, which are different from their roles in the
      holoenzyme. Here, we report that the regulatory cyclin H subunit of the cyclin
      H/cdk7/Mat1 complex was associated with a protein kinase activity, which shows
      some similarity with protein kinase CK2. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
      supported the existence of complexes of cyclin H and CK2 in mammalian cells. Far 
      Western blot experiments revealed that cyclin H bound to the alpha-subunit but
      not the alpha(')- and beta-subunits of CK2. Immunofluorescence analysis showed
      that cyclin H and CK2alpha were colocated in the nucleus. Although cyclin H
      functions as the regulatory subunit for the cyclin H/cdk7/Mat1 complex, it could 
      not substitute the regulatory beta-subunit of CK2 in its regulatory function of
      the CK2 activity.

TI  - The cyclin H/cdk7/Mat1 kinase activity is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation of
      cyclin H.
PG  - 5031-7
AB  - Cyclin dependent kinases are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
      of the catalytic cdk subunits, by assembly with specific cyclins and by specific 
      inhibitor molecules. Recently, it turned out that cyclins are also
      phosphoproteins, which means that they are also potential targets for a
      regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Here, we show that cyclin H 
      was phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2. Like most other CK2 substrates cyclin H
      was much better phosphorylated by the CK2 holoenzyme than by the alpha-subunit
      alone. By using point mutants derived from the cyclin H sequence we mapped the
      CK2 phosphorylation site at threonine 315 at the C-terminal end of cyclin H.
      Phosphorylation at this position had no influence on the assembly of the cyclin
      H/cdk7/Mat1 complex. However, phosphorylation at amino acid 315 of cyclin H
      turned out to be critical for a full cyclin H/cdk7/Mat1 kinase activity when the 
      CTD peptide of RNA polymerase II or cdk2 was used as a substrate.

TI  - A CDK-activating kinase network is required in cell cycle control and
      transcription in fission yeast.
PG  - 1100-5
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) involved in cell cycle control require activation
      by phosphorylation, but CDK-activating kinase (CAK) has diverged between
      metazoans and budding yeast. Fission yeast has two CAKs: the essential Mcs6
      complex, homologous to the metazoan CDK7 complex implicated in cell cycle control
      and transcription; and Csk1, a nonessential ortholog of budding yeast Cak1. Both 
      can activate the major CDK, Cdc2, but Csk1 can also activate Mcs6, so it was
      unclear whether the pathway is a linear cascade or a network. Here, we show that 
      a mutation, mcs6-13, which selectively abrogates CDK activation, blocks both G1/S
      and G2/M transitions, but only when csk1(+) is absent. In contrast, gradual
      depletion or rapid inactivation of Mcs6 in csk1(+) cells causes cell separation
      defects or growth arrest, respectively, accompanied by decreased phosphorylation 
      of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), but not of Cdc2. Finally, neither cell cycle
      arrest nor CAK failure is recapitulated by a second mutation in mcs6-13 that
      prevents Mcs6 activation by Csk1, indicating that Csk1 activates Cdc2 directly in
      vivo. Thus, Mcs6 acts in concert with Csk1 to activate Cdc2 and independently to 
      support transcription and facilitate cell separation. Csk1 likewise has multiple 
      physiologic targets, including Mcs6 and Cdc2.

TI  - Phosphorylation of human estrogen receptor alpha at serine 118 by two distinct
      signal transduction pathways revealed by phosphorylation-specific antisera.
PG  - 4921-31
AB  - Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a transcription factor that regulates
      expression of target genes in a ligand-dependent manner. Activation of gene
      expression is mediated by two transcription activation functions AF-1 and AF-2,
      which act in a promoter- and cell-specific manner. Whilst AF-2 activity is
      regulated by estrogen (E2) binding, the activity of AF-1 is additionally
      modulated by phosphorylation at several sites. One of these phosphorylation
      sites, serine 118 (S118) is of particular interest as its mutation significantly 
      reduces ERalpha activity. Previous studies have shown that S118 can be
      phosphorylated by the ERK1/2 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and by the 
      cyclin-dependent protein kinase Cdk7. In this study we use antisera that
      specifically recognize ERalpha phosphorylated at S118 to demonstrate that MAPK
      phosphorylates S118 in a ligand-independent manner, whereas Cdk7 mediates
      E2-induced phosphorylation of S118. E2 stimulation of S118 phosphorylation was
      observed within 10 min of its addition and was maximal at 10(-7) M E2. S118
      phosphorylation was maximal at 30 min but then declined, such that by 180 min
      following E2 addition little S118 phosphorylation was evident. S118
      phosphorylation was also induced by the partial estrogen antagonist
      4-hydroxytamoxifen, but not by the complete antagonist ICI 182, 780. S118
      phosphorylation upon addition of the MAPK inducers EGF or PMA followed the
      expected time courses. Finally, we show that ERalpha is phosphorylated at S118 in
      vivo using immunoblotting of extracts prepared from a series of ERalpha-positive 
      breast tumours.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat interaction with RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and a
      dynamic association with CDK2 induce CTD phosphorylation and transcription from
      HIV-1 promoter.
PG  - 33922-9
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), Tat protein activates viral gene
      expression through promoting transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II
      (RNAPII). In this process Tat enhances phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain
      (CTD) of RNAPII by activating cell cycle-dependent kinases (CDKs) associated with
      general transcription factors of the promoter complex, specifically CDK7 and
      CDK9. We reported a Tat-associated T-cell-derived kinase, which contained CDK2.
      Here, we provide further evidence that CDK2 is involved in Tat-mediated CTD
      phosphorylation and in HIV-1 transcription in vitro. Tat-mediated CTD
      phosphorylation by CDK2 required cysteine 22 in the activation domain of Tat and 
      amino acids 42-72 of Tat. CDK2 phosphorylated Tat itself, apparently by forming
      dynamic contacts with amino acids 15-24 and 36-49 of Tat. Also, amino acids 24-36
      and 45-72 of Tat interacted with CTD. CDK2 associated with RNAPII and was found
      in elongation complexes assembled on HIV-1 long-terminal repeat template.
      Recombinant CDK2/cyclin E stimulated Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription in
      reconstituted transcription assay. Immunodepletion of CDK2/cyclin E in HeLa
      nuclear extract blocked Tat-dependent transcription. We suggest that CDK2 is part
      of a transcription complex that is required for Tat-dependent transcription and
      that interaction of Tat with CTD and a dynamic association of Tat with
      CDK2/cyclin E stimulated CTD phosphorylation by CDK2.

TI  - Explant-induced reactivation of herpes simplex virus occurs in neurons expressing
      nuclear cdk2 and cdk4.
PG  - 7724-35
AB  - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes productive (lytic) infections in
      nonneuronal cells and nonproductive (latent) infections in neurons. It has been
      proposed that HSV establishes latency because quiescent neurons lack cellular
      factors required for productive infection. It has been further proposed that
      these putative factors are induced following neuronal stress, as a requirement
      for HSV reactivation. To date, the identity of these putative cellular factors
      remains unknown. We have demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 1, 2, or
      7 is required for HSV replication in nonneuronal cells. Interestingly, cdks 1 and
      2 are not expressed in quiescent neurons but can be induced in stressed neurons. 
      Thus, cdks may be among the cellular proteins required for HSV reactivation whose
      neuronal expression is differentially regulated during stress. Herein, we
      determined that neuronal expression of nuclear cdk2, cdk4, and cyclins E and D2
      (which activate cdks 2 and 4, respectively) was induced following explant
      cultivation, a stressful stimulus that induces HSV reactivation. In contrast,
      neuronal expression of cdk7 and cytoplasmic cdk4 decreased during explant
      cultivation, whereas cdk3 was detected in the same small percentage of neurons
      before and after explant cultivation and cdks 1, 5, and 6 were not detected in
      neuronal cell bodies. HSV-1 reactivated specifically in neurons expressing
      nuclear cdk2 and cdk4, and an inhibitor specific for cdk2 inhibited HSV-1
      reactivation. We conclude that neuronal levels of cdk2 are among the factors that
      determine the outcome of HSV infections of neurons.

TI  - Comparison of Cak1p-like cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinases.
PG  - 33482-9
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) coordinate progression through the eukaryotic
      cell cycle and require phosphorylation by a cdk-activating kinase (CAK) for full 
      activity. In most eukaryotes Cdk7 is the catalytic subunit of a heterotrimeric
      CAK (Cdk7-cyclin H-Mat1) that is also involved in transcription as part of the
      transcription factor IIH complex. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CAK, Cak1p, is a
      monomeric protein kinase with an atypical sequence and unusual biochemical
      properties compared with trimeric CAKs and other protein kinases. We sought to
      determine whether these properties were shared by a small group of monomeric CAKs
      that can function in place of CAK1 in S. cerevisiae. We found that
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe Csk1, Candida albicans Cak1, and Arabidopsis thaliana
      Cak1At, like Cak1p, all displayed a preference for cyclin-free cdk substrates,
      were insensitive to the protein kinase inhibitor
      5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA), and were insensitive to mutation of a
      highly conserved lysine residue found in the nucleotide binding pocket of all
      protein kinases. The S. pombe and C. albicans kinases also resembled Cak1p in
      their kinetics of nucleotide and protein substrate utilization. Conservation of
      these unusual properties in fungi and plants points to shared evolutionary
      requirements not met by Cdk7 and raises the possibility of developing antifungal 
      agents targeting CAKs.

TI  - The proto-oncogene c-myc acts through the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor
      p27(Kip1) to facilitate the activation of Cdk4/6 and early G(1) phase
      progression.
PG  - 31263-9
AB  - Progression through the early G(1) phase of the cell cycle requires mitogenic
      stimulation, which ultimately leads to the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases
      4 and 6 (Cdk4/6). Cdk4/6 activity is promoted by D-type cyclins and opposed by
      Cdk inhibitor proteins. Loss of c-myc proto-oncogene function results in a defect
      in the activation of Cdk4/6. c-myc(-/-) cells express elevated levels of the Cdk 
      inhibitor p27(Kip1) and reduced levels of Cdk7, the catalytic subunit of
      Cdk-activating kinase. We show here that in normal (c-myc(+/+)) cells, the
      majority of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes are assembled with p27 and remain inactive 
      during cell cycle progression; their function is presumably to sequester p27 from
      Cdk2 complexes. A small fraction of Cdk4/6 protein was found in lower molecular
      mass catalytically active complexes. Conditional overexpression of p27 in
      c-myc(+/+) cells caused inhibition of Cdk4/6 activity and elicited defects in
      G(0)-to-S phase progression very similar to those seen in c-myc(-/-) cells.
      Overexpression of cyclin D1 in c-myc(-/-) cells rescued the defect in Cdk4/6
      activity, indicating that the limiting factor is the number of cyclin D-Cdk4/6
      complexes. Cdk-activating kinase did not rescue Cdk4/6 activity. We propose that 
      the defect in Cdk4/6 activity in c-myc(-/-) cells is caused by the elevated
      levels of p27, which convert the low abundance activable cyclin D-Cdk4/6
      complexes into unactivable complexes containing higher stoichiometries of p27.
      These observations establish p27 as a physiologically relevant regulator of
      cyclin D-Cdk4/6 activity as well as mechanistically a target of c-Myc action and 
      provide a model by which c-Myc influences the early-to-mid G(1) phase transition.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat-associated RNA polymerase C-terminal domain kinase, CDK2,
      phosphorylates CDK7 and stimulates Tat-mediated transcription.
PG  - 649-57
AB  - HIV-1 gene expression is regulated by a viral transactivator protein (Tat) which 
      induces transcriptional elongation of HIV-1 long tandem repeat (LTR). This
      induction requires hyperphosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) repeats of
      RNA polymerase II (Pol II). To achieve CTD hyperphosphorylation, Tat stimulates
      CTD kinases associated with general transcription factors of the promoter
      complex, specifically TFIIH-associated CDK7 and positive transcription factor
      b-associated CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9). Other studies indicate that Tat
      may bind an additional CTD kinase that regulates the target-specific
      phosphorylation of RNA Pol II CTD. We previously reported that Tat-associated
      T-cell-derived kinase (TTK), purified from human primary T-cells, stimulates
      Tat-dependent transcription of HIV-1 LTR in vivo [Nekhai, Shukla, Fernandez,
      Kumar and Lamb (2000) Virology 266, 246-256]. In the work presented here, we
      characterized the components of TTK by biochemical fractionation and the function
      of TTK in transcription assays in vitro. TTK uniquely co-purified with CDK2 and
      not with either CDK9 or CDK7. Tat induced the TTK-associated CDK2 kinase to
      phosphorylate CTD, specifically at Ser-2 residues. The TTK fraction restored
      Tat-mediated transcription activation of HIV-1 LTR in a HeLa nuclear extract
      immunodepleted of CDK9, but not in the HeLa nuclear extract double-depleted of
      CDK9 and CDK7. Direct microinjection of the TTK fraction augmented Tat
      transactivation of HIV-1 LTR in human primary HS68 fibroblasts. The results argue
      that TTK-associated CDK2 may function to maintain target-specific phosphorylation
      of RNA Pol II that is essential for Tat transactivation of HIV-1 promoter. They
      are also consistent with the observed cell-cycle-specific induction of viral gene
      transactivation.

TI  - Molecular cloning and characterisation of p15(CDK-BP), a novel CDK-binding
      protein.
PG  - 219-31
AB  - The suc1/Cks proteins are well-conserved regulatory components of
      cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (CDK1/2). These small molecular mass proteins
      form a stable complex with CDK1/2 and are essential for normal regulation of CDKs
      during the cell division cycle and for degradation of p27(kip1). Despite the high
      degree of homology between the nine known CDKs, only CDK1, CDK2 and, to a lesser 
      extent, CDK3 are able to bind to the suc1/Cks proteins. No additional
      suc1/Cks-related proteins interacting with other CDKs have been reported. We have
      purified, from starfish oocytes, a 15 kDa protein, p15(CDK-BP), which
      cross-reacts with anti-Cks antibodies (L. Azzi, L. Meijer, A.C. Ostvold, J. Lew, 
      J.H. Wang, J. Biol. Chem. 269 (1994)). Following microsequencing of internal
      peptides and generation of corresponding oligonucleotides we cloned two cDNAs
      encoding two closely related proteins, p15A and p15B. The predicted protein
      sequences display distant but distinct homology with the Suc1/Cks proteins,
      including the genuine starfish Cks homologue protein, p9(CksMg). P15 transcripts 
      are essentially expressed in oocytes. Recombinant p15B or native p15(CDK-BP) bind
      a 34 kDa protein cross-reacting with anti-PSTAIRE antibodies, a feature
      characteristic of CDK-related proteins. In addition p15B interacts tightly with
      CDK4, CDK6, CDK8 and the yeast CDC28-related kinase Pho85, but not with CDK1,
      CDK2 or CDK7. P15 does not appear to alter the catalytic activity of the bound
      kinases.

TI  - cdk-7 Is required for mRNA transcription and cell cycle progression in
      Caenorhabditis elegans embryos.
PG  - 5527-32
AB  - CDK7 is a cyclin-dependent kinase proposed to function in two essential cellular 
      processes: transcription and cell cycle regulation. CDK7 is the kinase subunit of
      the general transcription factor TFIIH that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain 
      (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, and has been shown to be broadly required for
      transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CDK7 can also phosphorylate CDKs that 
      promote cell cycle progression, and has been shown to function as a
      CDK-activating kinase (CAK) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila
      melanogaster. That CDK7 performs both functions in metazoans has been difficult
      to prove because transcription is essential for cell cycle progression in most
      cells. We have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutation in Caenorhabditis
      elegans cdk-7 and have used it to analyze the role of cdk-7 in embryonic
      blastomeres, where cell cycle progression is independent of transcription.
      Partial loss of cdk-7 activity leads to a general decrease in CTD phosphorylation
      and embryonic transcription, and severe loss of cdk-7 activity blocks all cell
      divisions. Our results support a dual role for metazoan CDK7 as a broadly
      required CTD kinase, and as a CAK essential for cell cycle progression.

TI  - XPD mutations prevent TFIIH-dependent transactivation by nuclear receptors and
      phosphorylation of RARalpha.
PG  - 125-35
AB  - Inherited mutations in the XPD subunit of the general transcription/repair factor
      TFIIH yield the rare genetic disorder Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), the phenotypes 
      of which cannot be explained solely on the basis of a DNA repair defect. In cells
      derived from XP-D patients, we observed a reduction of the ligand-dependent
      transactivation mediated by several nuclear receptors (RARalpha, ERalpha, and
      AR). We demonstrate that the XPD mutation alters cdk7 function in RARalpha
      phosphorylation. Transactivation is restored upon overexpression of either the
      wild-type XPD or the RARalphaS77E (a mutation which mimics phosphorylated
      RARalpha). Thus, we demonstrate that the cdk7 kinase of TFIIH phosphorylates the 
      nuclear receptor, then allowing ligand-dependent control of the activation of the
      hormone-responsive genes.

TI  - Complexities in the development of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor drugs.
PG  - S32-7
AB  - Abnormalities in the normal regulation of the cell cycle are a hallmark of
      neoplasia. Drugs directed against the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which
      govern the normal orderly progression through the cell cycle, have been proposed 
      to address the pathogenic defect in tumors. Recently, CDK family members that do 
      not regulate the cell cycle directly but instead influence transcription (CDK7,
      CDK8, and CDK9) and neuronal and secretory cell function (CDK5) have been
      described. Continued synthetic chemistry efforts have defined important new
      selective inhibitors of CDKs, and strategies directed at newly described
      CDK-related targets, such as transcription control, can now be envisaged. CDKs
      remain important and novel targets whose potential needs to be more fully
      explored, albeit in light of the newly emerging complexities of their cellular
      physiology.

TI  - Human glioma PKC-iota and PKC-betaII phosphorylate cyclin-dependent kinase
      activating kinase during the cell cycle.
PG  - 23-36
AB  - Cell cycle phase transition is regulated in part by the trimeric enzyme,
      cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase (CAK) which phosphorylates and
      activates cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors
      prevent cell cycle phase transition, suggesting a fundamental role for PKCs in
      cell cycle regulation. We report that in glioma cells, CAK (cdk7) is
      constitutively associated with PKC-iota. In vitro phosphorylation,
      co-immunoprecipitation, and analysis of phosphorylated proteins by
      autoradiography indicate that CAK (cdk7) is a substrate for PKC-iota and
      PKC-betaII hyperphosphorylation. These results establish a role for PKC-iota and 
      PKC-betaII in the activation of CAK during the glioma cell cycle.

TI  - Kin28 is found within TFIIH and a Kin28-Ccl1-Tfb3 trimer complex with
      differential sensitivities to T-loop phosphorylation.
PG  - 1288-97
AB  - Basal transcription factor TFIIH phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II (RNApII)
      carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) within the transcription initiation complex. The
      catalytic kinase subunit of TFIIH is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase
      (Cdk) family, designated Kin28 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cdk7 in higher
      eukaryotes. Together with TFIIH subunits cyclin H and Mat1, Cdk7 kinase is also
      found in a trimer complex known as Cdk activating kinase (CAK). A yeast trimer
      complex has not previously been identified, although a Kin28-Ccl1 dimer called
      TFIIK has been isolated as a breakdown product of TFIIH. Here we show that a
      trimeric complex of Kin28-Ccl1-Tfb3 exists in yeast extracts. Several Kin28 point
      mutants that are defective in CTD phosphorylation were created. Consistent with
      earlier studies, these mutants have no transcriptional defect in vitro. Like
      other Cdks, Kin28 is activated by phosphorylation on T162 of the T loop. Kin28
      T162 mutants have no growth defects alone but do demonstrate synthetic phenotypes
      when combined with mutant versions of the cyclin partner, Ccl1. Surprisingly,
      these phosphorylation site mutants appear to destabilize the association of the
      cyclin subunit within the context of TFIIH but not within the trimer complex.

TI  - Modulation of MDM2/p53 and cyclin-activating kinase during the megakaryocyte
      differentiation of human erythroleukemia cells.
PG  - 158-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to address the involvement of CDK activating
      kinase (CAK), p53, and MDM2 proteins in the mitotic arrest associated with the
      acquisition of a polyploid DNA content during megakaryocyte differentiation of
      human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. METHODS: To evaluate this mechanism we
      investigated HEL cells as a model system in which there is a marked increase in
      DNA content during megakaryocyte differentiation induced by phorbol-diesters.
      Specific cell-cycle phases were separated by centrifugal elutriation and SDS PAGE
      and Western analysis were performed to determine the relative abundance of these 
      proteins. Kinase assays were carried out following immunoprecipitation of
      cellular lysates with the antibodies to the proteins. RESULTS: Polyploid HEL
      cells show an increase in the abundance of the CAK complex proteins, CDK7 and
      cyclin H, and a sixfold increase in CAK-specific activity. Increased CAK activity
      in polyploid HEL cells follows both the downregulation of p53 protein and its
      decreased association with CAK complex. Consistent with the reduction of p53,
      polyploid HEL cells undergo a dramatic increase in MDM2 protein abundance that in
      turn facilitates increased interaction of this protein with p53. CONCLUSION:
      These observations demonstrate that deregulated expression of MDM2 and p53 during
      megakaryocyte differentiation allow a relaxation of the control over genomic
      stability, allowing further replicative rounds of DNA synthesis.

TI  - Xenopus phospho-CDK7/cyclin H expressed in baculoviral-infected insect cells.
PG  - 252-60
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK) catalyzes the phosphorylation
      of the cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) on a threonine residue (Thr160 in 
      human CDK2). The reaction is an obligatory step in the activation of the CDKs. In
      higher eukaryotes, the CAK complex has been characterized in two forms. The first
      consists of three subunits, namely CDK7, cyclin H, and an assembly factor called 
      MAT1, while the second consists of phospho-CDK7 and cyclin H. Phosphorylation of 
      CDK7 is essential for cyclin association and kinase activity in the absence of
      the assembly factor MAT1. The Xenopus laevis CDK7 phosphorylation sites are
      located on the activation segment of the kinase at residues Ser170 and at Thr176 
      (the latter residue corresponding to Thr160 in human CDK2). We report the
      expression and purification of X. laevis CDK7/cyclin H binary complex in insect
      cells through coinfection with the recombinant viruses, AcCDK7 and Accyclin H.
      Quantities suitable for crystallization trials have been obtained. The purified
      CDK7/cyclin H binary complex phosphorylated CDK2 and CDK2/cyclin A but did not
      phosphorylate histone H1 or peptide substrates based on the activation segments
      of CDK7 and CDK2. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed that coexpression of CDK7 
      with cyclin H in baculoviral-infected insect cells results in phosphorylation of 
      residues Ser170 and Thr176 in CDK7. It is assumed that phosphorylation is
      promoted by kinase(s) in the insect cells that results in the correct,
      physiologically significant posttranslational modification. We discuss the
      occurrence of in vivo phosphorylation of proteins expressed in
      baculoviral-infected insect cells.

TI  - T-loop phosphorylation stabilizes the CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex in vivo and
      regulates its CTD kinase activity.
PG  - 3749-59
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)7-cyclin H, the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) and
      TFIIH-associated kinase in metazoans can be activated in vitro through T-loop
      phosphorylation or binding to the RING finger protein MAT1. Although the two
      mechanisms can operate independently, we show that in a physiological setting,
      MAT1 binding and T-loop phosphorylation cooperate to stabilize the CAK complex of
      Drosophila. CDK7 forms a stable complex with cyclin H and MAT1 in vivo only when 
      phosphorylated on either one of two residues (Ser164 or Thr170) in its T-loop.
      Mutation of both phosphorylation sites causes temperature-dependent dissociation 
      of CDK7 complexes and lethality. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr170 greatly
      stimulates the activity of the CDK7- cyclin H-MAT1 complex towards the C-terminal
      domain of RNA polymerase II without significantly affecting activity towards
      CDK2. Remarkably, the substrate-specific increase in activity caused by T-loop
      phosphorylation is due entirely to accelerated enzyme turnover. Thus
      phosphorylation on Thr170 could provide a mechanism to augment CTD
      phosphorylation by TFIIH-associated CDK7, and thereby regulate transcription.

TI  - A yeast four-hybrid system identifies Cdk-activating kinase as a regulator of the
      XPD helicase, a subunit of transcription factor IIH.
PG  - 35328-33
AB  - To understand the role of the various components of TFIIH, a DNA
      repair/transcription factor, a yeast four-hybrid system was designed. When the
      ternary Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex composed of Cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 
      was used as bait, the xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) D helicase of transcription
      factor IIH (TFIIH), among other proteins, was identified as an interacting
      partner. Deletion mutant analyses demonstrated that the coiled-coil and the
      hydrophobic domains of MAT1 interlink the CAK complex directly with the
      N-terminal domain of XPD. Using immunoprecipitates from cells coinfected with
      baculoviruses, we further validated the bridging function of XPD, which anchors
      CAK to the core TFIIH. In addition we show that upon interaction with MAT1, CAK
      inhibits the helicase activity of XPD. This inhibition is overcome upon binding
      to p44, a subunit of the core TFIIH. It is not surprising that under these
      conditions some XPD mutations affect interactions not only with p44, but also
      with MAT1, thus preventing either the CAK inhibitory function within CAK.XPD
      and/or the role of CAK within TFIIH and, consequently, explaining the variety of 
      the XP phenotypes.

TI  - Novel properties of the cyclin encoded by Human Herpesvirus 8 that facilitate
      exit from quiescence.
PG  - 3311-22
AB  - Viral DNA replication is generally dependent upon circumventing host cell cycle
      control to force S phase entry in an otherwise quiescent cell. Here we describe
      novel attributes of the cyclin encoded by Human Herpesvirus 8 (K cyclin) that
      enable it to subvert the quiescent state. K cyclin is most similar to the
      mammalian D-type cyclins in primary sequence but displays properties more akin to
      those of cyclin E. K cyclin (like cyclin E) can autonomously couple with its
      cognate cdk subunit and localize to the nucleus. D-type cyclins require mitogen
      stimulated accessory factors (such as p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1)) to facilitate both
      of these processes. A striking difference between K cyclin and mammalian cyclins 
      is that K cyclin binding to cdk6 can substantially activate the catalytic
      activity of the complex without the requirement for cyclin H/cdk7 phosphorylation
      of the cdk T-loop; this phosphorylation is obligatory for endogenous cyclin/cdk
      activity. However, K cyclin/cdk6 complexes are not totally immune from cell cycle
      control since CAK phosphorylation is necessary for complete activation. Thus, CAK
      phosphorylated K cyclin/cdk6 targets multiple sites in the retinoblastoma protein
      (pRb) whereas the unphosphorylated complex targets a single site. The restricted 
      substrate specificity of the non-CAK phosphorylated K cyclin/cdk6 complex is
      insufficient to enable K cyclin-mediated S phase entry. Thus, the viral K cyclin 
      is reliant upon endogenous CAK activity to subvert the quiescent state.

PG  - 124-8
AB  - Once a large proportion of the genes responsible for genetic disorders are
      identified in the post-genome era, the fundamental challenge is to establish a
      genotype/phenotype relationship. Our aim is to explain how mutations in a given
      gene affect its enzymatic function and, in consequence, disturb the life of the
      cell. Genome integrity is continuously threatened by the occurrence of DNA damage
      arising from cellular exposure to irradiation and genotoxic chemicals. This
      mutagenic or potentially lethal DNA damage induces various cellular responses
      including cell cycle arrest, transcription alteration and processing by DNA
      repair mechanisms, such as the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway.
      Disruption of NER in response to genotoxic injuries results in autosomal
      recessive hereditary diseases such as Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne
      syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). One of the most immediate
      consequences of the induction of strand-distorting lesions is the arrest of
      transcription in which TFIIH plays a role in addition to its role in DNA repair. 
      The observations made by clinicians close to XP, TTD and CS patients, suggested
      that transcription defects responsible for brittle hair and nails for TTD, or
      developmental abnormalities for CS, resulted from TFIIH mutations. Here a story
      will be related which could be called 'a multi-faceted factor named TFIIH'. As
      biochemists, we have characterized each component of TFIIH, three of which are
      XPB and XPD helicases and cdk7, a cyclin-dependent kinase. With the help of
      structural biologists, we have characterized most of the specific
      three-dimensional structures of TFIIH subunits and obtained its electron
      microscopy image. Together these approaches help us to propose a number of
      structure-function relationships for TFIIH. Through transfection and
      microinjection assays, cell biology allows us to determine the role of TFIIH in
      transcription and NER. We are thus in a position to explain, at least in part,
      transcription initiation mechanisms and their coupling to DNA repair. We now know
      how the XPB helicase opens the promoter region for RNA synthesis and that one of 
      the roles of XPD helicase is to anchor the cdk7 kinase to the core-TFIIH. In XP
      and CS associated patients, we have demonstrated that some XPD mutations prevent 
      an optimal phosphorylation of nuclear receptors by cdk7 with, as a consequence, a
      drop in the expression of genes sensitive to hormone action. We have thus shown
      that hormonal responses operate through TFIIH. Careful analysis of each TFIIH
      subunit also shows how the p44 Ring finger participates in certain promoter
      escape reactions. We are also able to localize the action of TFIIH in the
      sequence of events that lead to the elimination of DNA lesions. Thanks to the
      combination of these different approaches we are obtaining a much clearer picture
      of the TFIIH complex and its integration into the life of the cell.

TI  - Inability to enter S phase and defective RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation in
      mice lacking Mat1.
PG  - 2844-56
AB  - The trimeric Cdk7-cyclin H-Mat1 complex comprises the kinase subunit of basal
      transcription factor TFIIH and has been shown to function as a cyclin-dependent
      kinase (Cdk)-activating kinase. Herein we report that disruption of the murine
      Mat1 gene leads to peri-implantation lethality coincident with depletion of
      maternal Mat1 protein. In culture, Mat1(-/-) blastocysts gave rise to viable
      post-mitotic trophoblast giant cells while mitotic lineages failed to proliferate
      and survive. In contrast to wild-type trophoblast giant cells, Mat1(-/-) cells
      exhibited a rapid arrest in endoreduplication, which was characterized by an
      inability to enter S phase. Additionally, Mat1(-/-) cells exhibited defects in
      phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II on both Ser5 
      and Ser2 of the heptapeptide repeat. Despite this, Mat1(-/-) cells demonstrated
      apparent transcriptional and translational integrity. These data indicate an
      essential role for Mat1 in progression through the endocycle and suggest that
      while Mat1 modulates CTD phosphorylation, it does not appear to be essential for 
      RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription.

TI  - TFIIH action in transcription initiation and promoter escape requires distinct
      regions of downstream promoter DNA.
PG  - 5544-9
AB  - TFIIH is a multifunctional RNA polymerase II general initiation factor that
      includes two DNA helicases encoded by the Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
      group B (XPB) and D (XPD) genes and a cyclin-dependent protein kinase encoded by 
      the CDK7 gene. Previous studies have shown that the TFIIH XPB DNA helicase plays 
      critical roles not only in transcription initiation, where it catalyzes
      ATP-dependent formation of the open complex, but also in efficient promoter
      escape, where it suppresses arrest of very early RNA polymerase II elongation
      intermediates. In this report, we present evidence that ATP-dependent TFIIH
      action in transcription initiation and promoter escape requires distinct regions 
      of the DNA template; these regions are well separated from the promoter region
      unwound by the XPB DNA helicase and extend, respectively, approximately 23-39 and
      approximately 39-50 bp downstream from the transcriptional start site. Taken
      together, our findings bring to light a role for promoter DNA in TFIIH action and
      are consistent with the model that TFIIH translocates along promoter DNA ahead of
      the RNA polymerase II elongation complex until polymerase has escaped the
      promoter.

TI  - Meiotic expression of the cyclin H/Cdk7 complex in male germ cells of the mouse.
PG  - 1400-8
AB  - Cell division requires that cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) be activated by
      phosphorylation. In mitotic cells, this is accomplished by the
      Cdk-activating-kinase (CAK), which is a complex of cyclin H and Cdk7. There are
      currently no data on the role of CAK in meiotic cells. Previously, we have shown 
      that cyclin A1 is meiosis-specific and forms an active kinase with Cdk2. Because 
      cyclin A1 is required for meiosis, and its associated kinase must be
      phosphorylated (activated), we propose that cyclin H/Cdk7 function to activate
      cyclin A1/Cdk2 in meiotic cells. Here, we show that cyclin H and Cdk7 are present
      during meiosis. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in situ
      hybridization, we show that the mRNAs encoding cyclin H and Cdk7 are abundant in 
      spermatocytes. Immunohistochemistry localized cyclin H and Cdk7 to the nucleus of
      spermatocytes in stages IV to XII of the spermatogenic cycle, overlapping the
      same stages that express cyclin A1-associated kinases. Finally,
      immunoprecipitation and histone H1-kinase assays of cyclin H and Cdk7 from
      testicular extracts show that these proteins interact to form an active kinase.
      We conclude that cyclin H/Cdk7 complexes are present and during meiosis, form
      active complexes in testicular cells and are strong candidates for the activating
      kinase for cyclin A1-associated kinase.

TI  - Three RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain kinases display distinct
      substrate preferences.
PG  - 10913-20
AB  - CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9 are cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that phosphorylate the
      C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. They have distinct functions in
      transcription. Because the three CDKs target only serine 5 in the heptad repeat
      of model CTD substrates containing various numbers of repeats, we tested the
      hypothesis that the kinases differ in their ability to phosphorylate CTD heptad
      arrays. Our data show that the kinases display different preferences for
      phosphorylating individual heptads in a synthetic CTD substrate containing three 
      heptamer repeats and specific regions of the CTD in glutathione S-transferase
      fusion proteins. They also exhibit differences in their ability to phosphorylate 
      a synthetic CTD peptide that contains Ser-2-PO(4). This phosphorylated peptide is
      a poor substrate for CDK9 complexes. CDK8 and CDK9 complexes, bound to viral
      activators E1A and Tat, respectively, target only serine 5 for phosphorylation in
      the CTD peptides, and binding to the viral activators does not change the
      substrate preference of these kinases. These results imply that the display of
      different CTD heptads during transcription, as well as their phosphorylation
      state, can affect their phosphorylation by the different transcription-associated
      CDKs.

TI  - Strong functional interactions of TFIIH with XPC and XPG in human DNA nucleotide 
      excision repair, without a preassembled repairosome.
PG  - 2281-91
AB  - In mammalian cells, the core factors involved in the damage recognition and
      incision steps of DNA nucleotide excision repair are XPA, TFIIH complex,
      XPC-HR23B, replication protein A (RPA), XPG, and ERCC1-XPF. Many interactions
      between these components have been detected, using different physical methods, in
      human cells and for the homologous factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several
      human nucleotide excision repair (NER) complexes, including a high-molecular-mass
      repairosome complex, have been proposed. However, there have been no measurements
      of activity of any mammalian NER protein complex isolated under native
      conditions. In order to assess relative strengths of interactions between NER
      factors, we captured TFIIH from cell extracts with an anti-cdk7 antibody,
      retaining TFIIH in active form attached to magnetic beads. Coimmunoprecipitation 
      of other NER proteins was then monitored functionally in a reconstituted repair
      system with purified proteins. We found that all detectable TFIIH in gently
      prepared human cell extracts was present in the intact nine-subunit form. There
      was no evidence for a repair complex that contained all of the NER components. At
      low ionic strength TFIIH could associate with functional amounts of each NER
      factor except RPA. At physiological ionic strength, TFIIH associated with
      significant amounts of XPC-HR23B and XPG but not other repair factors. The
      strongest interaction was between TFIIH and XPC-HR23B, indicating a coupled role 
      of these proteins in early steps of repair. A panel of antibodies was used to
      estimate that there are on the order of 10(5) molecules of each core NER factor
      per HeLa cell.

TI  - Specificity of Cdk activation in vivo by the two Caks Mcs6 and Csk1 in fission
      yeast.
PG  - 82-90
AB  - Activating phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) is mediated by at
      least two structurally distinct types of Cdk-activating kinases (Caks): the
      trimeric Cdk7-cyclin H-Mat1 complex in metazoans and the single-subunit Cak1 in
      budding yeast. Fission yeast has both Cak types: Mcs6 is a Cdk7 ortholog and Csk1
      a single-subunit kinase. Both phosphorylate Cdks in vitro and rescue a
      thermosensitive budding yeast CAK1 strain. However, this apparent redundancy is
      not observed in fission yeast in vivo. We have identified mutants that exhibit
      phenotypes attributable to defects in either Mcs6-activating phosphorylation or
      in Cdc2-activating phosphorylation. Mcs6, human Cdk7 and budding yeast Cak1 were 
      all active as Caks for Cdc2 when expressed in fission yeast. Although Csk1 could 
      activate Mcs6, it was unable to activate Cdc2. Biochemical experiments supported 
      these genetic results: budding yeast Cak1 could bind and phosphorylate Cdc2 from 
      fission yeast lysates, whereas fission yeast Csk1 could not. These results
      indicate that Mcs6 is the direct activator of Cdc2, and Csk1 only activates Mcs6.
      This demonstrates in vivo specificity in Cdk activation by Caks.

TI  - Lower cyclin H and cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase activity in cell
      cycle arrest induced by lack of adhesion to substratum.
PG  - 7114-8
AB  - Knowledge about adhesion checkpoints is important to counteract dissemination of 
      cells from solid tumors. Lack of anchorage in adherent cells is associated with
      growth arrest and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) required to drive
      cell cycle progression. Because cyclin-cdk complex activation requires
      CDK-activating kinase comprising cdk7 and cyclin H, we now investigated their
      relationship to decreased proliferation by lack of cell spreading. This report
      shows that either UV irradiation on an adhesive substrate or culture on a
      nonadhesive substrate produced K1735 melanoma growth arrest. Inhibition of
      proliferation by UV primarily induced the cdk inhibitor p21WAF1 without a
      significant effect on cyclin H and cdk7. In contrast, lack of adhesion to
      substratum decreased cyclin H but not cdk7 with accumulation of a slower
      migrating, presumably unphosphorylated cdk4 isoform. These results were
      paralleled by decreased cdk7-mediated phosphorylation of GST-cdk2 and lower
      activation of a baculovirus-derived cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex. This is the
      first report showing that cyclin H-mediated down-regulation of cdk-activating
      kinase activity is involved in growth arrest induced by lack of anchorage.

TI  - Neuronal CDK7 in hippocampus is related to aging and Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 807-13
AB  - Despite their supposedly terminally-differentiated quiescent status, many neurons
      in Alzheimer disease display an ectopic re-expression of cell-cycle related
      proteins. In the highly regulated process of cell cycle, cyclin-dependent kinase 
      7 (Cdk7) plays a crucial role as a Cdk-activating kinase and activates all of the
      major Cdk-cyclin substrates. In this study, we demonstrate that Cdk7
      immunoreactivity is significantly elevated in susceptible hippocampal neurons of 
      Alzheimer disease patients in comparison with age-matched controls. Notably, the 
      expression of Cdk7 is age-dependent, with decreased levels between the ages of 54
      and 65 years and after the age of 78. While the Cdk7 levels in Alzheimer disease 
      patients are higher than controls within each age group, the difference is
      greatest between ages 54-65 where disease susceptibility and/or progression is
      likely more related to genetic factors.

TI  - Reciprocal activation by cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 7 is directed by
      substrate specificity determinants outside the T loop.
PG  - 88-99
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is the catalytic subunit of the metazoan
      CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which activates CDKs, such as CDC2 and CDK2, through
      phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the T loop. Full activation
      of CDK7 requires association with a positive regulatory subunit, cyclin H, and
      phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue at position 170 in its own T
      loop. We show that threonine-170 of CDK7 is phosphorylated in vitro by its
      targets, CDC2 and CDK2, which also phosphorylate serine-164 in the CDK7 T loop, a
      site that perfectly matches their consensus phosphorylation site. In contrast,
      neither CDK4 nor CDK7 itself can phosphorylate the CDK7 T loop in vitro. The
      ability of CDC2 or CDK2 and CDK7 to phosphorylate each other but not themselves
      implies that each kinase can discriminate among closely related sequences and can
      recognize a substrate site that diverges from its usual preferred site. To
      understand the basis for this paradoxical substrate specificity, we constructed a
      chimeric CDK with the T loop of CDK7 grafted onto the body of CDK2. Surprisingly,
      the hybrid enzyme, CDK2-7, was efficiently activated in cyclin A-dependent
      fashion by CDK7 but not at all by CDK2. CDK2-7, moreover, phosphorylated
      wild-type CDK7 but not CDK2. Our results suggest that the primary amino acid
      sequence of the T loop plays only a minor role, if any, in determining the
      specificity of cyclin-dependent CAKs for their CDK substrates and that
      protein-protein interactions involving sequences outside the T loop can influence
      substrate specificity both positively and negatively.

TI  - Phosphorylation in transcription: the CTD and more.
PG  - 3-13
AB  - Phosphorylation appears to be one mechanism in the regulation of transcription.
      Indeed, a multitude of factors involved in distinct steps of transcription,
      including RNA polymerase II, the general transcription factors, pre-mRNA
      processing factors, and transcription activators/repressors are phosphoproteins
      and serve as substrates for multiple kinases. Among these substrates, most
      attention has been paid in recent years to the phosphorylation of the
      carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and its role in transcription
      regulation. Kinases responsible for such CTD phosphorylation that are associated 
      with RNA polymerase II at distinct steps of transcription, such as cdk7 and cdk8,
      also phosphorylate some other components of the transcription machinery in a
      regulatory manner. These observations enlighten the pivotal role of such kinases 
      in an entangled regulation of transcription by phosphorylation. Summarizing the
      phosphorylation of various components of the transcription machinery, we point
      out the variety of steps in transcription that are regulated by such protein
      modifications, envisioning an interconnection of the several stages of mRNA
      synthesis by phosphorylation.

TI  - CDK-related protein kinases in plants.
PG  - 607-20
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) form a conserved superfamily of eukaryotic
      serine-threonine protein kinases, which require binding to a cyclin protein for
      activity. CDK are involved in different aspects of cell biology and notably in
      cell cycle regulation. The comparison of nearly 50 plant CDK-related cDNAs with a
      selected set of their animal and yeast counterparts reveals five classes of these
      genes in plants. These are described here with respect to their phylogenetic,
      structural and functional properties. A plant-wide nomenclature of CDK-related
      genes is proposed, using a system similar to that of the plant cyclin genes. The 
      most numerous class, CDKA, includes genes coding for CDK with the PSTAIRE
      canonical motif. CDKB makes up a class of plant-specific CDK divided into two
      groups: CDKB1 and CDKB2. CDKC, CDKD and CDKE form less numerous classes. The CDKD
      class includes the plant orthologues of metazoan CDK7, which correspond to the
      CDK-activating kinase (CAK). At present, no functional information is available
      in plants for CDKC and CDKE.

TI  - Identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA repair genes.
PG  - 1977-81
AB  - Variation in gene coding sequence represents a significant factor in
      predisposition to disease, including cancer. Variants of some DNA repair genes
      (e.g. MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6) are known to predispose to cancer. We identified
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five DNA repair genes in 142 healthy
      individuals using a DNA sequencing protocol optimized for the direct detection of
      single nucleotide polymorphisms. This approach, called the heterozygote
      sequencing protocol (HSP), enables moderate-scale population surveys of SNPs. HSP
      uses fluorescently tagged primers and exploits the large dynamic range and low
      background of automated fluorescent sequencing. HSP may be used for any sequence 
      that can be amplified by PCR. A total of 12 SNP variants in MGMT, ERCC1, CDK7,
      CCNH and XRCC4 were identified, 11 at polymorphic frequencies, with an average
      frequency of 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.20-0.24). Among the 82 individuals
      for whom complete SNP profiles were available, no one person carried the GenBank 
      reference sequence for all five genes. The extensive heterogeneity observed in
      these five genes is intriguing. All variants are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
      although the meaning of this equilibrium is unclear. Using this approach,
      possible associations of sequence variation, and hence of variation in DNA
      repair, with disease risk can be assessed.

PG  - 1849-70
AB  - In current models of cell cycle control, the transition between different cell
      cycle states is regulated at checkpoints. Transition through the cell-cycle is
      induced by a family of protein kinase holoenzymes, the cyclin-dependent kinases
      (CDKs) and their heterodimeric cyclin partner. Orderly progression through the
      cell-cycle involves co-ordinated activation of the CDKs, which in the presence of
      an associated CDK-activating kinase, phosphorylate target substrates including
      members of the 'pocket protein' family. This family includes the product of the
      retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (the pRb protein) and the related p107 and
      p130 proteins. Activity of these holoenzymes is regulated by post-translational
      modification. Phosphorylation of inhibitory sites on a conserved threonine
      residue within the activation segment is regulated by CDK7/cyclin H, referred to 
      as CDK-activating kinase [1]. In addition, the cdc25 phosphatases activate the
      CDKs by dephosphorylating their inhibitory tyrosine and threonine phosphorylated 
      residues [2,3]. Among the many roles for endogenous inhibitors (CDKIs), including
      members of the p21(CIP1/Waf1) family and the p16 family, one role is to regulate 
      cyclin activity. Cellular neoplastic transformation is accompanied by loss of
      regulation of cell cycle checkpoints in conjunction with aberrant expression of
      CDKs and/or cyclins and the loss or mutation of the negative regulators (the
      CDKIs or the pocket protein pRb). One strategy to inhibit malignant cellular
      proliferation involves inhibiting CDK activity or enhancing function of the CDKI.
      Novel inhibitors of CDKs showing promise in the clinic include flavopiridol and
      UCN-01, which show early evidence of human tolerability in clinical trials. This 
      review examines pertinent advances in the field of CDK inhibitors.

TI  - Screening a human population sample for DNA repair gene deficiencies utilizing
      the protein truncation test.
PG  - 228-34
AB  - A significant fraction of human cancers are thought to have a genetic component
      and several lines of evidence suggest that deficiencies in DNA repair may be a
      contributing factor. Little is known, however, about the frequency and
      distribution of variants of DNA repair genes in the general human population. The
      protein truncation test (PTT) was used to screen 136 healthy volunteers for
      protein-truncating variants of 10 DNA repair genes: APE, CDK7, ERCC1, WAF1,
      HOGG1, MGMT, POLB, UNG, HAAG, and CCNH. This sample consisted of 41males (30%)
      and 95 females (70%) with an average age of 25.3 years, ranging from 17 to 60
      years of age. No truncating mutations were found in the 10 genes examined in any 
      of the subjects. The 95% confidence interval for a proportion of 0 over the 272
      alleles examined per locus is 0-0.01. The calculated frequency of truncating
      mutations in each of these genes, among the general population, is thus less than
      1%. Among the 10 genes tested in 136 people, a single sample had no PCR product
      for HAAG, even though PCR products were obtained on all other genes. Total RNA
      dot hybridization confirmed the presence of HAAG mRNA transcripts in this sample.
      Despite identification of this single DNA repair variant, these results indicate 
      a low frequency of truncating mutations in DNA repair genes in the general
      population.

TI  - Molecular structure of human TFIIH.
PG  - 599-607
AB  - TFIIH is a multiprotein complex required for both transcription and DNA repair.
      Single particles of human TFIIH were revealed by electron microscopy and image
      processing at a resolution of 3.8 nm. TFIIH is 16 x 12.5 x 7.5 nm in size and is 
      organized into a ring-like structure from which a large protein domain protrudes 
      out. A subcomplex assembled from five recombinant core subunits also forms a
      circular architecture that can be superimposed on the ring found in human TFIIH. 
      Immunolabeling experiments localize several subunits: p44, within the ring
      structure, forms the base of the protruding protein density which includes the
      cdk7 kinase, cyclin H, and MAT1. Within the ring structure, p44 was flanked on
      either side by the XPB and XPD helicases. These observations provide us with a
      quartenary organizational model of TFIIH.

TI  - Regulation of CDK7-carboxyl-terminal domain kinase activity by the tumor
      suppressor p16(INK4A) contributes to cell cycle regulation.
PG  - 7726-34
AB  - The eukaryotic cell cycle is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK4
      and CDK6, which are activated by D-type cyclins during the G(1) phase of the cell
      cycle, are thought to be responsible for phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
      gene product (pRb). The tumor suppressor p16(INK4A) inhibits phosphorylation of
      pRb by CDK4 and CDK6 and can thereby block cell cycle progression at the G(1)/S
      boundary. Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large
      subunit of RNA polymerase II by general transcription factor TFIIH is believed to
      be an important regulatory event in transcription. TFIIH contains a CDK7 kinase
      subunit and phosphorylates the CTD. We have previously shown that p16(INK4A)
      inhibits phosphorylation of the CTD by TFIIH. Here we report that the ability of 
      p16(INK4A) to inhibit CDK7-CTD kinase contributes to the capacity to induce cell 
      cycle arrest. These results suggest that p16(INK4A) may regulate cell cycle
      progression by inhibiting not only CDK4-pRb kinase activity but also by
      modulating CDK7-CTD kinase activity. Regulation of CDK7-CTD kinase activity by
      p16(INK4A) thus may represent an alternative pathway for controlling cell cycle
      progression.

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma cell cycle: study of Long-Evans cinnamon rats.
PG  - 711-20
AB  - Amplification found in a number of cyclin genes, especially in cyclin D and E, is
      an important event process that takes place in cancers, including hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). The activities of a wide range of cell cycle-related kinases
      remain obscure in HCC. The purpose of the present study is to determine the
      cyclins and kinase activities of HCC in Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats. Cyclin
      D1, E, A, H, Cdk1(cyclin-dependent kinase; Cdc2), Cdk4, and Cdk6 protein levels
      were determined by Western blot analysis at different pathologic stages of liver 
      tissues exhibiting HCC. Enzymatic activities of cyclin D1, E, A, Cdk4, Cdk6,
      Cdc2, Cdk7, and Wee1 kinase were measured by in-gel kinase assay. Protein levels 
      and kinase activities of cyclin D1, E, Cdk4, cyclin A, and Wee1 increased
      proportionally with the development of HCC, especially in the transition process 
      from chronic hepatitis to HCC. Although Cdc2 kinase activity was found to
      increase slightly from normal liver to chronic hepatitis, its activity remained
      unchanged in the process from chronic hepatitis to HCC. Cdk6 and Cdk7 activities 
      remained unchanged in the process from normal liver to HCC. These data suggest
      that the increase in Cdc2 kinase may play a role in the process from normal liver
      to chronic hepatitis, whereas the predominant increase in cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin
      E, cyclin A, and Wee1 suggests involvement not only in the process from normal
      liver to chronic hepatitis, but also during transition into HCC.

TI  - TFIIH is negatively regulated by cdk8-containing mediator complexes.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - The mammalian cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (cdk8) gene has been linked with a subset
      of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, and its corresponding protein has been
      functionally implicated in regulation of transcription. Mammalian cdk8 and cyclin
      C, and their respective yeast homologues, Srb10 and Srb11, are components of the 
      RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex where they function as a protein kinase that
      phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA
      polymerase II (ref. 7). The yeast SRB10 and SRB11 genes have been implicated in
      the negative regulation of transcription. The cdk8/cyclin C protein complex is
      also found in a number of mammalian Mediator-like protein complexes, which
      repress activated transcription independently of the CTD in vitro. Here we show
      that cdk8/cyclin C can regulate transcription by targeting the cdk7/cyclin H
      subunits of the general transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH). cdk8
      phosphorylates mammalian cyclin H in the vicinity of its functionally unique
      amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal alpha-helical domains. This phosphorylation
      represses both the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and its CTD kinase 
      activity. In addition, mimicking cdk8 phosphorylation of cyclin H in vivo has a
      dominant-negative effect on cell growth. Our results link the Mediator complex
      and the basal transcription machinery by a regulatory pathway involving two
      cyclin-dependent kinases. This pathway appears to be unique to higher organisms.

TI  - Transcriptional activity of positive transcription elongation factor b kinase in 
      vivo requires the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 139-45
AB  - Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II
      (RNAPII) is an important step in transcription and the positive transcription
      elongation factor b (P-TEFb) has been proposed to facilitate elongation at many
      genes. The P-TEFb contains a catalytic subunit (Cdk9) that, in association with a
      cyclin subunit (cyclinT1), has the ability to phosphorylate the CTD substrate in 
      vitro. Here, we demonstrate that cyclinT1/Cdk9-mediated transcription requires
      CTD-containing RNAPII, suggesting that the CTD is the major target of the
      cyclinT1/Cdk9 complex in vivo. Unlike Cdk7 and Cdk8, two other cyclin-dependent
      kinases that are capable of phosphorylating the CTD in vitro, we found that only 
      the Cdk9 activates gene expression in a catalysis-dependent manner. Finally,
      unlike cyclinT1 and T2, we found that the targeted recruitment to promoter DNA of
      cyclinK (a recently described alternative partner of Cdk9) does not stimulate
      transcription in vivo. Collectively, our data strongly indicate that the P-TEFb
      kinase subunits cyclinT/Cdk9 are specifically involved in transcription and the
      CTD domain of RNAPII is the major functional target of this complex in vivo.

TI  - Interactions of Cdk7 and Kin28 with Hint/PKCI-1 and Hnt1 histidine triad
      proteins.
PG  - 34837-40
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) forms a trimeric complex with cyclin H and Mat1 
      to form the mammalian Cdk-activating kinase, CAK, as well as a part of the basal 
      transcription factor TFIIH, where Cdk7 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD)
      of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Here, we report a novel interaction
      between Cdk7 and a histidine triad (HIT) family protein, Hint/PKCI-1. This
      interaction was initially observed in a yeast two-hybrid study and subsequently
      verified by co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization studies, where
      overexpression of Cdk7 leads to partial relocalization of Hint to the nucleus.
      The physical association is independent of cyclin H binding or Cdk7 kinase
      activity and is conserved between the related Sacharomyces cerevisiae CTD kinase 
      Kin28 and the HIT protein Hnt1. Furthermore, combination of a disruption of HNT1 
      and a KIN28 temperature-sensitive allele in S. cerevisiae led to highly elongated
      cell morphology and reduced colony formation, indicating a genetic interaction
      between KIN28 and HNT1. The physical and genetic interactions of Hint and Hnt1
      with Cdk7 and Kin28 suggest a role for this class of histidine triad proteins in 
      the regulation of Cdk7 and Kin28 functions.

TI  - CDK9 autophosphorylation regulates high-affinity binding of the human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 tat-P-TEFb complex to TAR RNA.
PG  - 6958-69
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat interacts with cyclin T1 (CycT1),
      a regulatory partner of CDK9 in the positive transcription elongation factor
      (P-TEFb) complex, and binds cooperatively with CycT1 to TAR RNA to recruit P-TEFb
      and promote transcription elongation. We show here that Tat also stimulates
      phosphorylation of affinity-purified core RNA polymerase II and glutathione
      S-transferase-C-terminal-domain substrates by CycT1-CDK9, but not CycH-CDK7, in
      vitro. Interestingly, incubation of recombinant Tat-P-TEFb complexes with ATP
      enhanced binding to TAR RNA dramatically, and the C-terminal half of CycT1 masked
      binding of Tat to TAR RNA in the absence of ATP. ATP incubation lead to
      autophosphorylation of CDK9 at multiple C-terminal Ser and Thr residues, and
      full-length CycT1 (amino acids 728) [CycT1(1-728)], but not truncated
      CycT1(1-303), was also phosphorylated by CDK9. P-TEFb complexes containing a
      catalytically inactive CDK9 mutant (D167N) bound TAR RNA weakly and independently
      of ATP, as did a C-terminal truncated CDK9 mutant that was catalytically active
      but unable to undergo autophosphorylation. Analysis of different Tat proteins
      revealed that the 101-amino-acid SF2 HIV-1 Tat was unable to bind TAR with
      CycT1(1-303) in the absence of phosphorylated CDK9, whereas unphosphorylated CDK9
      strongly blocked binding of HIV-2 Tat to TAR RNA in a manner that was reversed
      upon autophosphorylation. Replacement of CDK9 phosphorylation sites with
      negatively charged residues restored binding of CycT1(1-303)-D167N-Tat, and
      rendered D167N a more potent inhibitor of transcription in vitro. Taken together,
      these results demonstrate that CDK9 phosphorylation is required for high-affinity
      binding of Tat-P-TEFb to TAR RNA and that the state of P-TEFb phosphorylation may
      regulate Tat transactivation in vivo.

TI  - Activation of estrogen receptor alpha by S118 phosphorylation involves a
      ligand-dependent interaction with TFIIH and participation of CDK7.
PG  - 127-37
AB  - Phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) N-terminal transcription
      activation function AF1 at serine 118 (S118) modulates its activity. We show here
      that human ERalpha is phosphorylated by the TFIIH cyclin-dependent kinase in a
      ligand-dependent manner. Furthermore, the efficient phosphorylation of S118
      requires a ligand-regulated interaction of TFIIH with AF2, the activation
      function located in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ERalpha. This interaction 
      involves (1) the integrity of helix 12 of the LBD/AF2 and (2) p62 and XPD, two
      subunits of the core TFIIH. These findings are suggestive of a novel mechanism by
      which nuclear receptor activity can be regulated by ligand-dependent recruitment 
      of modifying activities, such as kinases.

TI  - The effects of changing the site of activating phosphorylation in CDK2 from
      threonine to serine.
PG  - 32578-84
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that control cell cycle progression are regulated
      in many ways, including activating phosphorylation of a conserved threonine
      residue. This essential phosphorylation is carried out by the CDK-activating
      kinase (CAK). Here we examine the effects of replacing this threonine residue in 
      human CDK2 by serine. We found that cyclin A bound equally well to wild-type CDK2
      (CDK2(Thr-160)) or to the mutant CDK2 (CDK2(Ser-160)). In the absence of
      activating phosphorylation, CDK2(Ser-160)-cyclin A complexes were more active
      than wild-type CDK2(Thr-160)-cyclin A complexes. In contrast, following
      activating phosphorylation, CDK2(Ser-160)-cyclin A complexes were less active
      than phosphorylated CDK2(Thr-160)-cyclin A complexes, reflecting a much smaller
      effect of activating phosphorylation on CDK2(Ser-160). The kinetic parameters for
      phosphorylating histone H1 were similar for mutant and wild-type CDK2, ruling out
      a general defect in catalytic activity. Interestingly, the CDK2(Ser-160) mutant
      was selectively defective in phosphorylating a peptide derived from the
      C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. CDK2(Ser-160) was efficiently
      phosphorylated by CAKs, both human p40(MO15)(CDK7)-cyclin H and budding yeast
      Cak1p. In fact, the k(cat) values for phosphorylation of CDK2(Ser-160) were
      significantly higher than for phosphorylation of CDK2(Thr-160), indicating that
      CDK2(Ser-160) is actually phosphorylated more efficiently than wild-type CDK2. In
      contrast, dephosphorylation proceeded more slowly with CDK2(Ser-160) than with
      wild-type CDK2, either in HeLa cell extract or by purified PP2Cbeta. Combined
      with the more efficient phosphorylation of CDK2(Ser-160) by CAK, we suggest that 
      one reason for the conservation of threonine as the site of activating
      phosphorylation may be to favor unphosphorylated CDKs following the degradation
      of cyclins.

TI  - Retinoic acid-mediated G1 arrest is associated with induction of p27(Kip1) and
      inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 3 in human lung squamous carcinoma CH27
      cells.
PG  - 322-31
AB  - Retinoids are promising agents for the prevention and treatment of several human 
      malignancies including lung cancer. In this study, the effect of retinoic acid
      (RA) on cell growth and the mechanism of growth modulation were examined in human
      lung squamous carcinoma CH27 cells. Here we report that RA mediated the dose- and
      time-dependent growth arrest in G1 phase, accompanied by the up-regulation of
      p27(Kip1) and the down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 3 (Cdk3) and
      p21(CIP1/Waf1) proteins. Furthermore, RA-induced growth arrest of CH27 cells was 
      also associated with increased retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) and reduced 
      c-Myc expression. However, RA had no effect on the levels of cyclins A, D1, D3,
      E, or H, or on Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk5, CDk6, Cdk7, p16(Ink4A), p15(Ink4B), p53, or pRb 
      proteins in CH27 cells. Evaluation of the kinase activity of cyclin-Cdk complexes
      showed that RA increases p27(Kip1) expression in CH27 cells leading to markedly
      reduced cyclin A/Cdk2 kinase activity and slightly reduced cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase
      activity, with no effect on cyclin D/Cdk4 and cyclin D/Cdk6 activities. Moreover,
      coincident with the decrease in kinase activity was a drastic increase in cyclin 
      A-bound p27(Kip1). These results suggest that increases in the levels of
      p27(Kip1) and its binding to cyclin A, as well as reduction of Cdk3 protein
      expression, are strong candidates for the cell cycle regulator that prevents the 
      entry into the S phase in RA-treated CH27 cells, with prolongation of G1 phase
      and inhibition of DNA synthesis.

TI  - Modulation of TFIIH-associated kinase activity by complex formation and its
      relationship with CTD phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 407-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: The general transcription factor TFIIH plays important roles in
      initiation and the transition to elongation steps of transcription by RNA
      polymerase II (PolII). Both roles are dependent on the protein kinase,
      DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities of TFIIH. However, how these
      enzyme activities of TFIIH contribute to transcription has remained elusive.
      TFIIH consists of nine subunits, and one of them, Cdk7, possesses kinase
      activity. Here the substrate specificities of TFIIH and two forms of the
      Cdk7-containing kinase complex are compared, and the relationship between
      transcription activity and the TFIIH-dependent phosphorylation of the carboxy
      terminal domain of the largest subunit of PolII (CTD) is studied. RESULTS: We
      prepared TFIIH and two Cdk7-containing kinase complexes, Cdk7/Cyclin H and CAK
      (Cdk7/Cyclin H/MAT1). Consistent with previous reports, CAK strongly
      phosphorylated Cdk2, Cdk4, CTD and intact PolII. In contrast, Cdk7/Cyclin H,
      which lacks MAT1, did not phosphorylate these substrates, except for weak
      phosphorylation of Cdk2. The kinase activity of TFIIH displayed stronger
      substrate preference for Cdk4 than did CAK. In addition, TFIIH phosphorylation of
      PolII was stimulated by TFIIE both in solution and during preinitiation complex
      formation, whereas Cdk7/Cyclin H and CAK phosphorylation of PolII was not. In
      combination with other general transcription factors, TFIIH, but not Cdk7/CycH or
      CAK, promoted transcription on a linear DNA template. This transcription was well
      correlated with TFIIE stimulated TFIIH phosphorylation of serine at position 5
      (Ser-5) within the heptapeptide repeat of the PolII CTD. CONCLUSION: These
      results provide clues about the roles of CTD phosphorylation at Ser-5 in
      transcription.

TI  - Analysis of CAK activities from human cells.
PG  - 4213-21
AB  - The cdk-activating kinase (CAK) activates cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) that
      control cell-cycle progression by phosphorylating a threonine residue conserved
      in cdks. CAK from humans contains p40MO15 (cdk7), cyclin H and MAT1, which are
      also subunits of transcription factor IIH where they phosphorylate the C-terminal
      domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. In contrast, budding yeast
      Cak1p is a monomeric enzyme without C-terminal domain kinase activity. Here, we
      analyze CAK activities in HeLa cells using cdk2-affinity chromatography. In
      addition to MO15, a second CAK activity was detected that runs on gel filtration 
      at 30-40 kDa. This activity phosphorylated and activated cdk2 and cdk6.
      Furthermore, this 'small CAK' activity resembled Cak1p rather than MO15 in terms 
      of substrate specificity, reactivity to antibodies against MO15 and Cak1p, and
      sensitivity to 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, an irreversible inhibitory ATP 
      analog. Our findings suggest the presence of at least two different CAK
      activities in human cells.

TI  - Tat modifies the activity of CDK9 to phosphorylate serine 5 of the RNA polymerase
      II carboxyl-terminal domain during human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      transcription.
PG  - 5077-86
AB  - Tat stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional
      elongation by recruitment of carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) kinases to the HIV-1 
      promoter. Using an immobilized DNA template assay, we have analyzed the effect of
      Tat on kinase activity during the initiation and elongation phases of HIV-1
      transcription. Our results demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7)
      (TFIIH) and CDK9 (P-TEFb) both associate with the HIV-1 preinitiation complex.
      Hyperphosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) CTD in the HIV-1
      preinitiation complex, in the absence of Tat, takes place at CTD serine 2 and
      serine 5. Analysis of preinitiation complexes formed in immunodepleted extracts
      suggests that CDK9 phosphorylates serine 2, while CDK7 phosphorylates serine 5.
      Remarkably, in the presence of Tat, the substrate specificity of CDK9 is altered,
      such that the kinase phosphorylates both serine 2 and serine 5. Tat-induced CTD
      phosphorylation by CDK9 is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of 5,
      6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, an inhibitor of transcription
      elongation by RNAP II. Analysis of stalled transcription elongation complexes
      demonstrates that CDK7 is released from the transcription complex between
      positions +14 and +36, prior to the synthesis of transactivation response (TAR)
      RNA. In contrast, CDK9 stays associated with the complex through +79. Analysis of
      CTD phosphorylation indicates a biphasic modification pattern, one in the
      preinitiation complex and the other between +36 and +79. The second phase of CTD 
      phosphorylation is Tat-dependent and TAR-dependent. These studies suggest that
      the ability of Tat to increase transcriptional elongation may be due to its
      ability to modify the substrate specificity of the CDK9 complex.

TI  - Cdk7- and Cdc25A-independent dephosphorylation of Cdk2 during phorbol
      ester-mediated cell cycle arrest in U937 cells.
PG  - 145-51
AB  - The molecular mechanism underlying protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated cell cycle
      arrest is poorly understood. We undertook to characterize phorbol ester-activated
      PKC-mediated cell cycle arrest. Treatment with phorbol ester inhibited cell
      growth of human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells with 83% of the cells arrested in
      G1 phase. Reduced activity of cdk2 correlated with cdk2 dephosphorylation and
      accumulation of cdk2 inhibitor p21Waf in phorbol ester-treated cells.
      Dephosphorylation of cdk2 was not associated with cdk7 and cdc25A activity in
      phorbol ester-treated cells. Protein phosphatase inhibitor assays suggest that
      the dephosphorylation of cdk2 results in the activation of a specific protein
      tyrosine phosphatase. Thus, dephosphorylation of cdk2 as well as accumulation of 
      cdk2 inhibitor is likely to contribute to the G1 phase arrest in phorbol
      ester-treated in U937 cells.

TI  - Distinct regions of MAT1 regulate cdk7 kinase and TFIIH transcription activities.
PG  - 22815-23
AB  - The transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH may be resolved into at least two
      subcomplexes: the core TFIIH and the cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex. The CAK
      complex, which is also found free in the cell, is composed of cdk7, cyclin H, and
      MAT1. In the present work, we found that the C terminus of MAT1 binds to the cdk7
      x cyclin H complex and activates the cdk7 kinase activity. The median portion of 
      MAT1, which contains a coiled-coil motif, allows the binding of CAK to the TFIIH 
      core through interactions with both XPD and XPB helicases. Furthermore, using
      recombinant TFIIH complexes, it is demonstrated that the N-terminal RING finger
      domain of MAT1 is crucial for transcription activation and participates to the
      phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of the RNA
      polymerase II.

TI  - HIV-1 replication is inhibited by a pseudo-substrate peptide that blocks Tat
      transactivation.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - The activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by the viral
      transcriptional transactivator Tat is an essential step in the viral replication 
      cycle. To increase the processivity of RNA polymerase II, Tat interacts with the 
      positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and cyclin-dependent kinase
      (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK). In this study, we demonstrate that a
      pseudo-substrate peptide for CDK7, mC2p, inhibits HIV-1 replication as well as
      Tat transactivation. Specifically, mC2p blocks only the activity of CAK and not
      that of P-TEFb. Moreover, mC2p inhibits Tat transactivation and HIV replication. 
      Therefore, the activation of CDK7 by Tat is considered a critical step of Tat
      transactivation and mC2p and related compounds represent potential candidates for
      novel anti-HIV therapeutics.

TI  - Cell cycle-dependent localization of the CDK2-cyclin E complex in Cajal (coiled) 
      bodies.
PG  - 1543-52
AB  - We have found that CDK2 and cyclin E, but not cyclin A, accumulates within Cajal 
      bodies (CBs) in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. In the absence of cyclin E, CDK2 
      is not enriched in the CB compartment, suggesting that the translocation of CDK2 
      to CBs is dependent on cyclin E. CDK2 and cyclin E could be recruited to CBs as a
      functional complex or CBs may serve as 'docking stations' for CDK2-cyclin E
      activation by CAKs during the G(1)/S transition. Notably, CDK7-cyclin H-Mat1
      complexes are known to accumulate in CBs. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of
      either CDKs (olomoucine, 200 microM) or RNA polymerase I (actinomycin D, 0.05
      microgram/ml), results in a striking reorganization of CDK2 and p80 coilin to the
      nucleolar periphery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p80 coilin can be
      phosphorylated by purified CDK2-cyclin E complexes in vitro. Thus coilin and
      other CB proteins appear to be downstream targets of CDK2-cyclin E
      complex-mediated signaling pathways regulating cell cycle progression and
      controlling aspects of CB function. Possible roles for CDK2 and cyclin E in the
      well-documented association of CBs, histone gene clusters and RNA 3' end
      processing factors are discussed.

TI  - TFIIH interacts with the retinoic acid receptor gamma and phosphorylates its
      AF-1-activating domain through cdk7.
PG  - 21896-904
AB  - Retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARgamma) is phosphorylated in COS-1 cells at two
      conserved serine residues located in the N-terminal region (serines 77 and 79 in 
      RARgamma1 and serines 66 and 68 in RARgamma2) that contains the activation
      function AF-1. These serines are phosphorylated in vitro by cdk7, a
      cyclin-dependent kinase associated to cyclin H and MAT1 in the CAK complex
      (cdk7.cyclin H. MAT1), that is found either free or as a component of the
      transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH. RARgamma is more efficiently
      phosphorylated by TFIIH than by CAK and interacts not only with cdk7 but also
      with several additional subunits of TFIIH. RARgamma phosphorylation and
      interaction with TFIIH occur in a ligand-independent manner. Our data demonstrate
      also that phosphorylation of the AF-1 function modulates RARgamma transcriptional
      activity in a response gene-dependent manner.

TI  - Dominant-negative mutants reveal a role for the Cdk7 kinase at the mid-blastula
      transition in Drosophila embryos.
PG  - 1567-75
AB  - The metazoan cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk7 was purified originally as part of a
      biochemical activity called CAK (Cdk-activating kinase) capable of
      phosphorylating and activating in vitro the Cdks that promote the different cell 
      cycle transitions. Cdk7 is also found in the transcription factor complex TFIIH, 
      suggesting that it participates in vivo in the control of RNA polymerase II. We
      have examined the physiological role of Cdk7 during the course of Drosophila
      development. By expressing dominant-negative forms of the kinase, we were able to
      alter Cdk7 function at given developmental stages. Expression of Cdk7 mutants
      severely delayed the onset of zygotic transcription in the early embryo, but did 
      not alter the timing of the first 13 embryonic nuclear cycles. These results
      implicate Cdk7 in the control of transcriptional machinery in vivo. While cell
      cycle regulation is not sensitive to our manipulations of Cdk7 activity, it
      suggests that a distinct pool of CAK activity that is unaffected by expression of
      the cdk7(DN) mutants is present in these embryos.

TI  - Effect of 9-cis-retinoic acid on oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.
PG  - 199-208
AB  - Retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to be effective in suppressing premalignant
      lesions and preventing second primary malignancies in patients cured of squamous 
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck. However, the precise mechanisms of these
      effects are still uncertain. In the present study, we examined the effect of
      9-cis-RA on the growth of six oral cancer cell lines (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4,
      Ca9-22, Ho-1-N-1 and Ho-1-u-1). In addition, the relationship among growth and
      differentiation of tumor cells, RA responsiveness and the expression of nuclear
      retinoic acid receptors were also investigated. Among the six cell lines
      examined, five (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, Ca9-22 and Ho-1-u-1) displayed growth
      inhibition after treatment with 1x10(-6) M 9-cis-RA, while Ho-1-N-1 cells were
      resistant to 9-cis-RA. The expression level of RARbeta in 9-cis-RA resistant
      Ho-1-N-1 cells was very low in comparison with the sensitive cell lines. On the
      other hand, all of the six the cell lines expressed RARalpha, RARgamma, and
      RXRalpha at various levels. 9-cis-RA induced accumulation of cell population in
      G1 phase in HSC-3 cells on the 6th day of the treatment, followed by a marked
      reduction in the levels of hyperphosphorylated pRB, whereas p53 level was not
      altered. Interestingly, 9-cis-RA induced transiently the expression of
      p21(Waf1/Cip1), p27(Kip1), p300, CBP, BAX, Bak and bcl-2 proteins, respectively. 
      This effect was associated with reduction of cyclin D1, cdk4 and CDK-activating
      kinase (cyclin H and cdk7) protein in HSC-3 cells. These results suggest that the
      growth inhibitory effect of 9-cis-RA on oral squamous cell carcinoma may depend
      on the expression levels of RARs, especially RARbeta proteins and RXRalpha
      proteins, and that 9-cis-RA may provide a powerful therapeutic agent for head and
      neck cancers.

TI  - Cell cycle regulation and RNA polymerase II.
PG  - D244-57
AB  - The cell cycle and transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) are closely
      related. They utilize shared components. RNAP II transcriptional activity is
      modulated during the cell cycle. Cell cycle dependent changes in the
      phosphorylation status of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest
      subunit of RNAP II (RNAP II-LS) alter transcription. Several CTD kinases are
      members of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) superfamily, including p34cdc2
      (cdk1), cdk7, cdk8, and cdk9. Each of these cdks, with their respective cyclin
      partners, have been linked to cell cycle regulatory events. Other CTD kinases
      such as casein kinase II (CKII) and c-abl have also been implicated in cell cycle
      dependent modifications of the CTD. In addition, the stalling of RNAP II
      complexes at DNA lesions helps stimulate p53 accumulation which largely
      determines the cell's DNA damage response, including cell cycle arrest.
      Alzheimer's disease pathology results partially from activation of mitotic cdks
      in postmitotic neurons which can phosphorylate RNAP II-LS and other targets.

PG  - 2532-8
AB  - To provide an explanation of some clinical features observed within rare
      xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients and to further define the role of XPB, XPD,
      and cdk7, the three enzymatic subunits of TFIIH, in the transcription reaction,
      we have examined two defined enzymatic steps: phosphodiester bond formation and
      promoter escape. We provide evidence that the XPB helicase plays a dominant role 
      in initiation, whereas the XPD helicase plays a minor contributing role in this
      step. The cyclin-activating kinase subcomplex of TFIIH improves the efficiency of
      initiation, but this involves only the structural contributions of
      cyclin-activating kinase rather than enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that XPB 
      patient-derived mutants in TFIIH suffer from defects in initiation. Moreover,
      mutant analysis shows that in addition to its crucial role in initiation, the XPB
      helicase plays a critical enzymatic role in the promoter escape, whereas XPD
      plays an important structural role in the promoter escape process. Finally, using
      patient-derived mutations in TFIIH, we demonstrate deficiencies in promoter
      escape for both mutants of the class that suffer from combined xeroderma
      pigmentosum/Cockayne's syndrome.

TI  - Changes in cyclin dependent kinase expression and activity accompanying lens
      fiber cell differentiation.
PG  - 695-703
AB  - Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that differentiating lens fiber 
      cells contain two active cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks), Cdk1 and Cdk5. The
      present study was undertaken to explore the expression and regulation of six
      additional members of the Cdk family (Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdk7 and Cdk8)
      during lens differentiation. Differentiating lens fiber cells were separated from
      lens epithelial cells by microdissection of developing rat lenses [embryonic day 
      16 (E16) to postnatal day 8 (P8)] and Cdk expression was assessed by RT-PCR and
      immunoblotting. Two Cdks (Cdk3 and Cdk6) were not expressed in lens fiber cells
      or epithelial cells during this developmental period. In the lens epithelium, we 
      detected proteins and mRNAs corresponding to all other Cdks examined (Cdk2, Cdk4,
      Cdk7, Cdk8) throughout this developmental period. Epithelial cells showed
      significant Cdk2 activity, which decreased with developmental age, but no
      significant activity was detected for Cdk4, Cdk7, or Cdk8. Fiber cells contained 
      all four Cdk proteins and the corresponding Cdk mRNAs except for Cdk2 mRNA. None 
      of the Cdks examined showed significant kinase activity in fiber cells.
      Immunoprecipitates of Cdk2 and Cdk4 from fiber cells contained p57(kip2),
      supporting the view that this Cdk inhibitor blocks the activity of these Cdks in 
      lens fibers. In contrast, p57(kip2)did not co-immunoprecipitate with Cdk5 from
      lens fibers. These findings suggest that the differential affinity of
      p57(kip2)for members of the Cdk family may provide a mechanism for specific
      regulation of individual Cdks during fiber cell differentiation.

TI  - Transforming growth factor beta targeted inactivation of cyclin
      E:cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complexes by inhibition of Cdk2 activating
      kinase activity.
PG  - 14961-6
AB  - Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-mediated G(1) arrest previously has
      been shown to specifically target inactivation of cyclin D:cyclin-dependent
      kinase (Cdk) 4/6 complexes. We report here that TGF-beta-treated human HepG2
      hepatocellular carcinoma cells arrest in G(1), but retain continued cyclin
      D:Cdk4/6 activity and active, hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor 
      protein. Consistent with this observation, TGF-beta-treated cells failed to
      induce p15(INK4b), down-regulate CDC25A, or increase levels of p21(CIP1),
      p27(KIP1), and p57(KIP2). However, TGF-beta treatment resulted in the specific
      inactivation of cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes caused by absence of the activating
      Thr(160) phosphorylation on Cdk2. Whole-cell lysates from TGF-beta-treated cells 
      showed inhibition of Cdk2 Thr(160) Cdk activating kinase (CAK) activity; however,
      cyclin H:Cdk7 activity, a previously assumed mammalian CAK, was not altered.
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a genetically and biochemically proven CAK
      gene, CAK1, that encodes a monomeric 44-kDa Cak1p protein unrelated to Cdk7.
      Anti-Cak1p antibodies cross-reacted with a 45-kDa human protein with CAK activity
      that was specifically down-regulated in response to TGF-beta treatment. Taken
      together, these observations demonstrate that TGF-beta signaling mediates a G(1) 
      arrest in HepG2 cells by targeting Cdk2 CAK and suggests the presence of at least
      two mammalian CAKs: one specific for Cdk2 and one for Cdk4/6.

TI  - Regulation of G(1) cyclin-dependent kinases in the liver: role of nuclear
      localization and p27 sequestration.
PG  - G1207-16
AB  - Recent studies suggest that cyclin D1 mediates progression of hepatocytes through
      G(1) phase of the cell cycle. The present study further examines the regulation
      of cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity and the interplay between cyclin D1 and
      other G(1) phase regulatory proteins during liver regeneration. After 70% partial
      hepatectomy in rats, there was upregulation of kinase activity associated with
      cyclins (A, D1, D3, and E), cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk2 and Cdk4), and
      Cdk-inhibitory proteins (p27, p107, and p130). Although cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes 
      were more abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction after partial hepatectomy, kinase 
      activity was detected primarily in the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic cyclin
      D1/Cdk4 complexes were activated by recombinant cyclin H/Cdk7. Because endogenous
      Cdk7 activity was found in the nucleus, this suggests that activation of cyclin
      D1/Cdk4 requires nuclear importation and subsequent phosphorylation by cyclin
      H/Cdk7. Recombinant cyclin E/Cdk2 was inhibited by extracts from quiescent liver,
      and cyclin D1 could titrate out this inhibitory activity. Induction of cyclin D1 
      was accompanied by increased abundance of cyclin D1/p27 complexes, and most p27
      was sequestered by cyclin D1 after partial hepatectomy. Thus cyclin D1 appears to
      play two roles during G(1) phase progression in the regenerating liver: it forms 
      a nuclear kinase complex, and it promotes activation of Cdk2 by sequestering
      inhibitory proteins such as p27. These experiments underscore the complexity of
      cyclin/Cdk regulatory networks in the regenerating liver.

TI  - The disappearance of cyclins A and B and the increase in activity of the
      G(2)/M-phase cellular kinase cdc2 in herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells
      require expression of the alpha22/U(S)1.5 and U(L)13 viral genes.
PG  - 8-15
AB  - In uninfected cells the G(2)/M transition is regulated by cyclin kinase complex
      containing cdc2 and, initially, cyclin A, followed by cyclin B. cdc2 is
      downregulated through phosphorylation by wee-1 and myt-1 and upregulated by
      cdc-25C phosphatase. We have examined the accumulation and activities of these
      proteins in cells infected with wild type and mutants of herpes simplex virus 1. 
      The results were as follows. (i) Cyclin A and B levels were reduced beginning 4 h
      after infection and were undetectable at 12 to 16 h after infection. (ii) cdc2
      protein also decreased in amount but was detectable at all times after infection.
      In addition, a fraction of cdc2 protein from infected cells exhibited altered
      electrophoretic mobility in denaturing gels. (iii) The levels of cdk7 or myt-1
      proteins remained relatively constant throughout infection, whereas the level of 
      wee-1 was significantly decreased. (iv) cdc-25C formed novel bands characterized 
      by slower electrophoretic mobility that disappeared after treatment with
      phosphatase. In addition, one phosphatase-sensitive band reacted with MPM-2
      antibody that recognizes a phosphoepitope phosphorylated exclusively in M phase. 
      (v) cdc2 accumulating in infected cells exhibited kinase activity. The activity
      of cdc2 was higher in infected cell lysates than those of corresponding proteins 
      present in lysates of mock-infected cells even though cyclins A and B were not
      detectable in lysates of infected cells. (vi) The decrease in the levels of
      cyclins A and B, the increase in activity of cdc2, and the hyperphosphorylation
      of cdc-25C were mediated by U(L)13 and alpha22/U(S)1.5 gene products. In light of
      its normal functions, the activated cdc2 kinase may play a role in the changes in
      the morphology of the infected cell. These results are consistent with the
      accruing evidence that herpes simplex virus scavenges the cell for useful cell
      cycle proteins and subverts them for its own use.

TI  - Rapid analysis of gene expression (RAGE) facilitates universal expression
      profiling.
PG  - 4609-18
AB  - Current techniques for analysis of gene expression either monitor one gene at a
      time, for example northern hybridization or RT-PCR methods, or are designed for
      the simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes, for example microarray
      hybridization or serial analysis of gene expression. To provide a flexible,
      intermediate scale alternative, a PCR-based method for the rapid analysis of gene
      expression has been developed which allows expression changes to be determined in
      either a directed search of known genes, or an undirected survey of unknown
      genes. A single set of reagents and reaction conditions allows analyses of most
      genes in any eukaryote. The method is useful for assaying on the order of tens to
      hundreds of genes in multiple samples. Control experiments indicate reliable
      detection of changes in gene expression 2-fold and greater, and sensitivity of
      detection better than 1 in 10 000. Analyses of over 400 genes in a mouse system
      transgenic for the E2F1 gene have identified several new downstream targets of
      E2F1, including Brca1 and Cdk7, in addition to several unidentified genes that
      are upregulated in the transgenic mice. Changes in expression of several genes
      related to apoptosis suggest a possible potentiation of apoptotic pathways in the
      transgenic keratinocytes.

      triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells.
PG  - 5765-72
AB  - Most modern chemo- and radiotherapy treatments of human cancers use the DNA
      damage pathway, which induces a p53 response leading to either G1 arrest or
      apoptosis. However, such treatments can induce mutations and translocations
      leading to secondary malignancies or recurrent disease, which often have a poor
      prognosis because of resistance to therapy. Here we report that 5,
      6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), an inhibitor of CDK7
      TFIIH-associated kinase, CKI and CKII kinases, blocking RNA polymerase II in the 
      early elongation stage, triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in human colon
      adenocarcinoma cells in a transcription independent manner. The fact that DRB
      kills tumour-derived cells without employment of DNA damage gives rise to the
      possibility of the development of a new alternative chemotherapeutic treatment of
      tumours expressing wild type p53, with a decreased risk of therapy-related,
      secondary malignancies.

TI  - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)-induced retardation of the G(2)/M traverse is
      associated with decreased levels of p34(cdc2) in HL60 cells.
PG  - 226-34
AB  - Cellular differentiation of neoplastic cells after exposure to 1,
      25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25 D(3)) is accompanied by altered cell cycle
      regulation. In previous studies, blocks in both G(1)/S and G(2)/M checkpoints
      have been observed in 1,25D(3)-treated HL60 cells, but the mechanism of the
      1,25D(3)-induced G(2)/M block has not been previously reported. In this study, we
      show by cell cycle analysis, using bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase labeling, that
      the G(2)/M block in 1,25D(3)-treated HL60 cells is incomplete. We also
      demonstrate that although the 1,25D(3)-treated cells exhibit elevated levels of
      cyclin B1, Cdc25C, and Cdk7, which are positive regulators of the G(2)/M
      traverse, these cells have decreased protein levels of p34(cdc2) and decreased
      p34(cdc2) kinase activity. This provides potential mechanisms for the observed
      accumulation of cells in the G(2) cell cycle compartment and occasional
      polyploidization following treatment of HL60 cells with 1,25D(3). The data also
      suggest that the ability of some cells to traverse this block may be the result
      of cellular compensatory mechanisms responding to decreased p34(cdc2) activity by
      increasing the levels of other regulators of the G(2) traverse, such as cyclin
      B1, Cdc25C, and Cdk7.

TI  - Molecular cloning of a cell cycle regulation gene cyclin H from ischemic rat
      brain: expression in neurons after global cerebral ischemia.
PG  - 1598-608
AB  - Gene expression plays an important role in determining the fate of neurons after 
      ischemia. To identify additional genes that promote survival or execute
      programmed cell death in ischemic neurons, a subtractive cDNA library was
      constructed from hippocampus of rats subjected to global ischemia. With use of a 
      differential screening technique, a cDNA was identified that was up-regulated
      after ischemia. The cDNA was found to have high homology with human cyclin H at
      both the nucleotide level (89%) and the amino acid level (93%). Northern blotting
      detected cyclin H mRNA in nonischemic and ischemic brains. In situ hybridization 
      studies revealed that cyclin H message was found in hippocampal neurons in
      nonischemic brain. After ischemia, expression was increased primarily in the
      dentate gyrus and CA3 regions of hippocampus. Expression of cyclin H protein,
      detected by western blotting of hippocampal tissue, was increased after global
      ischemia, but expression of cyclins B1 and D1 and other related cell cycle genes 
      (Cdk7 and Cdc2) was not increased. Cyclin H immunoreactivity was found
      exclusively within neurons. After ischemia, there was increased immunoreactivity 
      within neurons in dentate gyrus, CA3, and cortex. Thus, cyclin H is expressed in 
      normal postmitotic neurons and expression is increased in neurons that are
      ischemic yet survive. These results suggest that cyclin H may have functions in
      neurons other than cell cycle regulation, including other known functions such as
      DNA repair.

TI  - Synthetic cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. New generation of potent
      anti-cancer drugs.
PG  - 341-53
AB  - The unsatisfactory results of current anti-cancer therapies require the active
      search for new drugs, new treatment strategies and a deeper understanding of the 
      host-tumour relationship. From this point of view, the drugs with a capacity to
      substitute the functions of altered tumour suppressor genes are of prominent
      interest. Since one of the main functions of oncosuppressors is to mediate cell
      cycle arrest via modification of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) activity, the
      compounds with ability to substitute altered functions of these genes in
      neoplastic cells are of prominent interest. Synthetic inhibitors of cyclin
      dependent kinases (CDKIs) are typical representatives of such drugs. Olomoucine
      (OC), flavopiridol (FP), butyrolactone I (BL) and their derivatives selectively
      inhibit CDKs and thus constrain tumor cell proliferation under in vitro and/or in
      vivo conditions. We originally discovered OC and its inhibitory activity toward
      CDK1 family of CDKs, and recently reported the induction of apoptosis and tumor
      regression following OC application. Moreover, the OC family of synthetic CDKIs
      has the capacity of directly inhibit CDK7, the principal enzyme required for
      activating other CDKs, and thus these compounds are the first known CDK7
      inhibitors. Its unique mechanism of action and potent anti-cancer activity under 
      both in vitro and in vivo conditions provide a unique tool to inhibit tumour cell
      proliferation, and to selectively induce apoptosis in neoplastic tissues. The
      mechanisms of anti-cancer activities of FP, BL, OC and related synthetic CDKIs
      are compared and discussed in this paper.

TI  - Regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 catalytic activity by phosphorylation.
PG  - 11156-60
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) is found in an active form only in neuronal
      cells. Activation by virtue of association with the cyclin-like neuronal proteins
      p35 (or its truncated form p25) and p39 is the only mechanism currently shown to 
      regulate cdk5 catalytic activity. In addition to cyclin binding, other members of
      the cdk family require for maximal activation phosphorylation of a Ser/Thr
      residue (Thr(160) in the case of cdk-2) that is conserved in all cdks except
      cdk8. This site is phosphorylated by cdk-activating kinases, which, however, do
      not phosphorylate cdk5. To examine the possible existence of a
      phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism in the case of cdk5, we have
      metabolically labeled PC12 cells with (32)P(i) and shown that the endogenous cdk5
      is phosphorylated. Bacterially expressed cdk5 also can be phosphorylated by PC12 
      cell lysates. Phosphorylation of cdk5 by a PC12 cell lysate results in a
      significant increase in cdk5/p25 catalytic activity. Ser(159) in cdk5 is
      homologous to the regulatory Thr(160) in cdk2. A Ser(159)-to-Ala (S159A) cdk5
      mutant did not show similar activation, which suggests that cdk5 is also
      regulated by phosphorylation at this site. Like other members of the cdk family, 
      cdk5 catalytic activity is influenced by both p25 binding and phosphorylation. We
      show that the cdk5-activating kinase (cdk5AK) is distinct from the cdk-activating
      kinase (cyclin H/cdk7) that was reported previously to neither phosphorylate cdk5
      nor affect its activity. We also show that casein kinase I, but not casein kinase
      II, can phosphorylate and activate cdk5 in vitro.

TI  - In vivo transcription factor recruitment during thyroid hormone receptor-mediated
      activation.
PG  - 10092-7
AB  - Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) can act as both a transcriptional activator and a
      silencer. Optimal activation by TR requires synergism with activator(s) bound to 
      the promoter (promoter proximal activator). It is thought that liganded TR either
      helps to recruit preinitiation complexes (PIC) to the promoter or activates the
      PIC already recruited. However, the studies analyzing the TR action on the PIC
      formation were done in vitro and, therefore, it is not clear how relevant they
      are to the in vivo TR action. For example, in vivo, the TR can act from distances
      equal to or greater than a kilobase from the promoter, but such distant effect is
      not reproducible in vitro. In this study, we used the PIN*POINT (ProteIN POsition
      Identification with Nuclease Tail) assay to define the molecular mechanism of TR 
      action on transcription from the thymidine kinase promoter in the cellular
      context. We demonstrate that the recruitment of promoter-proximal activator Sp1, 
      and the components of the basal transcription factors such as TBP, TFIIB, and
      Cdk7, is enhanced with thyroid hormone activation. Our results suggest that DNA
      forms a loop with TR-mediated activation to accommodate interactions between the 
      liganded TR complex and the complex formed on the promoter. We also show that Sp1
      bound to the promoter is essential for the DNA looping and recruitment of basal
      transcription factors such as TFIIB and Cdk7 but not for recruitment of TBP. On
      the basis of these findings, we present a model that illustrates the molecular
      mechanism of TR-mediated activation in vivo.

TI  - A role for the TFIIH XPB DNA helicase in promoter escape by RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 22127-30
AB  - TFIIH is an RNA polymerase II transcription factor that performs ATP-dependent
      functions in both transcription initiation, where it catalyzes formation of the
      open complex, and in promoter escape, where it suppresses arrest of the early
      elongation complex at promoter-proximal sites. TFIIH possesses three known
      ATP-dependent activities: a 3' --> 5' DNA helicase catalyzed by its XPB subunit, 
      a 5' --> 3' DNA helicase catalyzed by its XPD subunit, and a carboxyl-terminal
      domain (CTD) kinase activity catalyzed by its CDK7 subunit. In this report, we
      exploit TFIIH mutants to investigate the contributions of TFIIH DNA helicase and 
      CTD kinase activities to efficient promoter escape by RNA polymerase II in a
      minimal transcription system reconstituted with purified polymerase and general
      initiation factors. Our findings argue that the TFIIH XPB DNA helicase is
      primarily responsible for preventing premature arrest of early elongation
      intermediates during exit of polymerase from the promoter.

TI  - Activating phosphorylation of the Kin28p subunit of yeast TFIIH by Cak1p.
PG  - 4774-87
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinases (CAKs) carry out essential
      activating phosphorylations of CDKs such as Cdc2 and Cdk2. The catalytic subunit 
      of mammalian CAK, MO15/Cdk7, also functions as a subunit of the general
      transcription factor TFIIH. However, these functions are split in budding yeast, 
      where Kin28p functions as the kinase subunit of TFIIH and Cak1p functions as a
      CAK. We show that Kin28p, which is itself a CDK, also contains a site of
      activating phosphorylation on Thr-162. The kinase activity of a T162A mutant of
      Kin28p is reduced by approximately 75 to 80% compared to that of wild-type
      Kin28p. Moreover, cells containing kin28(T162A) and a conditional allele of TFB3 
      (the ortholog of the mammalian MAT1 protein, an assembly factor for MO15 and
      cyclin H) are severely compromised and display a significant further reduction in
      Kin28p activity. This finding provides in vivo support for the previous
      biochemical observation that MO15-cyclin H complexes can be activated either by
      activating phosphorylation of MO15 or by binding to MAT1. Finally, we show that
      Kin28p is no longer phosphorylated on Thr-162 following inactivation of Cak1p in 
      vivo, that Cak1p can phosphorylate Kin28p on Thr-162 in vitro, and that this
      phosphorylation stimulates the CTD kinase activity of Kin28p. Thus, Kin28p joins 
      Cdc28p, the major cell cycle Cdk in budding yeast, as a physiological Cak1p
      substrate. These findings indicate that although MO15 and Cak1p constitute
      different forms of CAK, both control the cell cycle and the phosphorylation of
      the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II by TFIIH.

TI  - c-Myc regulates cyclin D-Cdk4 and -Cdk6 activity but affects cell cycle
      progression at multiple independent points.
PG  - 4672-83
AB  - c-myc is a cellular proto-oncogene associated with a variety of human cancers and
      is strongly implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, programmed cell 
      death, and differentiation. We have previously reported the first isolation of a 
      c-myc-null cell line. Loss of c-Myc causes a profound growth defect manifested by
      the lengthening of both the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. To gain a clearer
      understanding of the role of c-Myc in cellular proliferation, we have performed a
      comprehensive analysis of the components that regulate cell cycle progression.
      The largest defect observed in c-myc-/- cells is a 12-fold reduction in the
      activity of cyclin D1-Cdk4 and -Cdk6 complexes during the G0-to-S transition.
      Downstream events, such as activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2
      complexes, are delayed and reduced in magnitude. However, it is clear that c-Myc 
      affects the cell cycle at multiple independent points, because restoration of the
      Cdk4 and -6 defect does not significantly increase growth rate. In exponentially 
      cycling cells the absence of c-Myc reduces coordinately the activities of all
      cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes. An analysis of cyclin-dependent kinase 
      complex regulators revealed increased expression of p27(KIP1) and decreased
      expression of Cdk7 in c-myc-/- cells. We propose that c-Myc functions as a
      crucial link in the coordinate adjustment of growth rate to environmental
      conditions.

TI  - Cdc2 activation in fission yeast depends on Mcs6 and Csk1, two partially
      redundant Cdk-activating kinases (CAKs).
PG  - 441-4
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are fully active only when phosphorylated by a
      Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) [1]. Metazoan CAK is itself a Cdk, Cdk7, whereas the 
      CAK of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a distinct enzyme unrelated to Cdks [1]. The
      Mcs6-Mcs2 complex of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a putative CAK related to the
      metazoan enzyme [2] [3]. Although the loss of Mcs6 is lethal, it results in a
      phenotype that is inconsistent with a failure to activate Cdc2, the major Cdk in 
      S. pombe [3]. We therefore tested the ability of Csk1, a putative regulator of
      Mcs6 [4], to activate Cdk-cyclin complexes in vitro. Csk1 activated both the
      monomeric and the Mcs2-bound forms of Mcs6. Surprisingly, Csk1 also activated
      Cdc2 in complexes with either Cdc13 or Cig2 cyclins. When a double mutant
      carrying a csk1 deletion and a temperature-sensitive mcs6 allele was incubated at
      the restrictive temperature, Cdc2 was not activated and the cells underwent a
      cell division arrest prior to mitosis. Cdc2-cyclin complexes isolated from the
      arrested cells could be activated in vitro by recombinant CAK, whereas complexes 
      from wild-type cells or either of the single mutants were refractory to
      activation. Thus, fission yeast contains two partially redundant CAKs: the
      Mcs6-Mcs2 complex and Csk1. Inactivation of both CAKs is necessary and sufficient
      to prevent Cdc2 activation and cause a cell-cycle arrest. Mcs6, which is
      essential, may therefore have required functions other than Cdk activation.

TI  - Inhibition of transcription by the trimeric cyclin-dependent kinase 7 complex.
PG  - 13162-6
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) can be isolated as a subunit of a trimeric
      kinase complex functional in activation of the mitotic promoting factor. In this 
      study, we demonstrate that the trimeric cdk-activating kinase (CAK) acts as a
      transcriptional repressor of class II promoters and show that repression results 
      from CAK impeding the entry of RNA polymerase II and basal transcription factor
      IIF into a competent preinitiation complex. This repression is independent of
      CDK7 kinase activity. We find that the p36/MAT1 subunit of CAK is required for
      transcriptional repression and the repression is independent of the promoter
      used. Our results demonstrate a central role for CAK in regulation of messenger
      RNA synthesis by either inhibition of RNA polymerase II-catalyzed transcription
      or stimulation of transcription through association with basal transcription
      repair factor IIH.

TI  - The cdk-activating kinase (CAK): from yeast to mammals.
PG  - 284-96
AB  - Cell cycle progression is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). The
      activity of cdks is tightly controlled by several mechanisms, including binding
      of subunits to cdks (cyclins and inhibitors), and phosphorylation events. This
      review focuses on the activating phosphorylation of cdks by an enzyme termed
      cdk-activating kinase (CAK). Two classes of CAKs have been identified: monomeric 
      Cak1p from budding yeast and the p40MO15 (cdk7)/cyclin H/MAT1 complex from
      vertebrates. Cak1p is the physiological CAK in budding yeast and localizes to the
      cytoplasm. p40MO15(cdk7)/cyclin H/MAT1 localizes to the nucleus, is a subunit of 
      the general transcription factor IIH and activates cdks as well as phosphorylates
      several components of the transcriptional machinery. Functions, substrate
      specificities, regulation, localization, effects on cdk structure and involvement
      in transcription are compared for Cak1p and p40MO15(cdk7).

TI  - A rice homolog of Cdk7/MO15 phosphorylates both cyclin-dependent protein kinases 
      and the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 613-9
AB  - The activation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) requires
      phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the T-loop by a CDK-activating
      kinase (CAK). The R2 protein of rice is very similar to CAKs of animals and
      fission yeast at the amino acid level but phosphorylation by R2 has not yet been 
      demonstrated. When R2 was overexpressed in a CAK-deficient mutant of budding
      yeast, it suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the mutation.
      Immunoprecipitates of rice proteins with the anti-R2 antibody phosphorylated
      human CDK2, one of the rice CDKs (Cdc2Os1), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD)
      of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II of Arabidopsis. Mutational analysis
      indicated that R2 phosphorylated the threonine residue within the T-loop of CDK2 
      and Cdc2Os1. R2 was found mainly in two protein complexes which had molecular
      masses of 190 kDa and 70 kDa, respectively, whilst the CDK- and CTD-kinase
      activities associated with R2 were identified in a complex of 105 kDa. These
      results indicate that R2 is closely related to CAKs of animals and fission yeast 
      in terms of its phosphorylation activity and, moreover, that this CAK of rice is 
      distinct from a CAK of the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis.

TI  - RNA antisense abrogation of MAT1 induces G1 phase arrest and triggers apoptosis
      in aortic smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 5564-72
AB  - The human MAT1 gene (menage a trois 1) is an assembly factor and a targeting
      subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase. The novel mechanisms 
      by which MAT1 forms an active CDK-activating kinase and determines substrate
      specificity of CDK7-cyclin H are involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair, and
      transcription. Hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) is a fundamental
      pathologic feature of luminal narrowing in vascular occlusive diseases, and
      nothing is yet known regarding the cell cycle phase specificity of the MAT1 gene 
      in its involvement in SMC proliferation. To investigate such novel regulatory
      pathways, MAT1 expression was abrogated by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of
      antisense MAT1 RNA in cultured rat aortic SMCs. We show that abrogation of MAT1
      expression retards SMC proliferation and inhibits cell activation from a
      nonproliferative state. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that these effects are 
      due to G1 phase arrest and apoptotic cell death. Our studies indicate a link
      between cell cycle control and apoptosis and reveal a potential mechanism for
      coupling the regulation of MAT1 with G1 exit and prevention of apoptosis.

TI  - Reconstitution of the transcription factor TFIIH: assignment of functions for the
      three enzymatic subunits, XPB, XPD, and cdk7.
PG  - 87-95
AB  - To understand the initiation of the transcription of protein-coding genes, we
      have dissected the role of the basal transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH.
      Having succeeded in reconstituting a functionally active TFIIH from baculovirus
      recombinant polypeptides, we were able to analyze the role of XPB, XPD, and cdk7 
      subunits in the transcription reaction. Designing mutated recombinant subunits,
      we show that the XPB helicase is absolutely required for transcription to open
      the promoter around the start site whereas the XPD helicase, which is
      dispensable, stimulates transcription and allows the CAK complex to be anchored
      to TFIIH. In addition, we also show that cdk7 may phosphorylate the
      carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II in the absence of promoter opening.

TI  - Cyclin C/CDK8 and cyclin H/CDK7/p36 are biochemically distinct CTD kinases.
PG  - 1093-102
AB  - Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II is
      important for basal transcriptional processes in vivo and for cell viability.
      Several kinases, including certain cyclin-dependent kinases, can phosphorylate
      this substrate in vitro. It has been proposed that differential CTD
      phosphorylation by different kinases may regulate distinct transcriptional
      processes. We have found that two of these kinases, cyclin C/CDK8 and cyclin
      H/CDK7/p36, can specifically phosphorylate distinct residues in recombinant CTD
      substrates. This difference in specificity may be largely due to their varying
      ability to phosphorylate lysine-substituted heptapeptide repeats within the CTD, 
      since they phosphorylate the same residue in CTD consensus heptapeptide repeats. 
      Furthermore, this substrate specificity is reflected in vivo where cyclin C/ CDK8
      and cyclin H/CDK7/p36 can differentially phosphorylate an endogenous RNA
      polymerase II substrate. Several small-molecule kinase inhibitors have different 
      specificities for these related kinases, indicating that these enzymes have
      diverse active-site conformations. These results suggest that cyclin C/CDK8 and
      cyclin H/CDK7/p36 are physically distinct enzymes that may have unique roles in
      transcriptional regulation mediated by their phosphorylation of specific sites on
      RNA polymerase II.

TI  - Functional domains of Tat required for efficient human immunodeficiency virus

PG  - 2499-508
AB  - Tat expression is required for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      (HIV-1) reverse transcription. In the present study, we generated a series of 293
      cell lines that contained a provirus with a tat gene deletion (Deltatat). Cell
      lines that contained Deltatat and stably transfected vectors containing either
      wild-type tat or a number of tat mutants were obtained so that the abilities of
      these tat genes to stimulate HIV-1 gene expression and reverse transcription
      could be compared. tat genes with mutations in the amino terminus did not
      stimulate either viral gene expression or HIV-1 reverse transcription. In
      contrast, tat mutants in the activation, core, and basic domains of Tat did not
      stimulate HIV-1 gene expression but markedly stimulated HIV-1 reverse
      transcription. No differences in the levels of virion genomic RNA or tRNA3Lys
      were seen in the HIV-1 Deltatat viruses complemented with either mutant or
      wild-type tat. Finally, overexpression of the Tat-associated kinases CDK7 and
      CDK9, which are involved in Tat activation of HIV-1 transcription, was not able
      to complement the reverse transcription defects associated with the lack of a
      functional tat gene. These results indicate that the mechanism by which tat
      modulates HIV-1 reverse transcription is distinct from its ability to activate
      HIV-1 gene expression.

TI  - An RNA polymerase II complex containing all essential initiation factors binds to
      the activation domain of PAR leucine zipper transcription factor thyroid
      embryonic factor.
PG  - 1242-50
AB  - Transcription initiation of protein-encoding genes involves the assembly of RNA
      polymerase II and a number of general transcription factors at the promoter. A
      mammalian RNA polymerase II complex containing all of the components required for
      promoter-specific transcription initiation can be isolated by immunopurification 
      with a monoclonal antibody directed against the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK7, a
      subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH. In vitro transcription by this
      immunopurified RNA polymerase II complex is effectively stimulated by thyroid
      embryonic factor (TEF), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor. Thus, the
      RNA polymerase II complex must also contain components required for activated
      transcription that interact with the transactivation domain of TEF. This
      conjecture was verified by affinity selection experiments in which the TEF
      transcription activation domain was used as a bait. Indeed, an RNA polymerase II 
      complex containing all of the accessory proteins required for transcription
      initiation can be enriched by its affinity to recombinant proteins containing the
      TEF transactivation domain. These results are compatible with a mechanism by
      which TEF can recruit an RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to the promoter in a single
      step.

TI  - Fission yeast Csk1 is a CAK-activating kinase (CAKAK).
PG  - 7230-8
AB  - Cell cycle progression is dependent on the sequential activity of
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). For full activity, CDKs require an activating
      phosphorylation of a conserved residue (corresponding to Thr160 in human CDK2)
      carried out by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Two distinct CAK kinases have
      been described: in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Cak1/Civ1 kinase
      is responsible for CAK activity. In several other species including human,
      Xenopus, Drosophila and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, CAK has been
      identified as a complex homologous to CDK7-cyclin H (Mcs6-Mcs2 in fission yeast).
      Here we identify the fission yeast Csk1 kinase as an in vivo activating kinase of
      the Mcs6-Mcs2 CAK defining Csk1 as a CAK-activating kinase (CAKAK).

TI  - Regulation of CAK kinase activity by p53.
PG  - 2733-41
AB  - The growth suppressor p53 is an important key element which controls cell cycle
      progression in response to cellular stress like DNA damage. Its ability to act as
      transcriptional activator or repressor links transcription and cell cycle
      control. Several target genes selectively transactivated by p53 are implicated in
      growth control, apoptosis and DNA repair. Here we report the interaction of p53
      with another important dual player of cell cycle control and transcription, the
      protein kinase complex CDK7/cyclin H/Mat1 (CDK activating kinase, CAK kinase).
      This is implicated in the activating phosphorylation of CDK2/cyclin A kinase
      required to allow cells to proceed through the G1/S transition, and on the other 
      hand, as a component of the basal transcription factor TFIIH found to be
      necessary for CTD phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in order to allow
      elongation of transcription. Based on previous binding studies of p53 with other 
      C-terminal interaction partners of p53 we demonstrate a direct physical
      interaction of p53 with cyclin H in vitro and in vivo. As a consequence of this
      interaction we tested the influence of p53 on the kinase activity of CAK kinase
      for CTD and CDK2 phosphorylation. The addition of wild type p53 to the kinase
      reactions resulted in a significant downregulation of CDK2 phosphorylation and
      CTD phosphorylation by the CDK activating kinase. On the other hand addition of a
      mutant p53His175 failed to downregulate CDK2 and CTD phosphorylation by the CDK
      activating kinase. In an attempt to support our findings in vivo we measured CAK 
      kinase activity in p21-/- and p53-/- mice embryonal fibroblasts under conditions 
      when p53 gets activated by irradiation. In the case of p21-/- cells this led to a
      significant reduction of CTD phosphorylation activity of the CDK activating
      kinase by irradiation of the cells. On the other hand in p53 cells no
      downregulation of CTD phosphorylation activity of CAK kinase was observed
      indicating that this kind of negative regulation of CAK kinase activity is
      exclusively due to a functional p53. These findings imply a direct involvement of
      p53 in triggering growth arrest by its interaction with the CDK activating kinase
      complex without the need of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) and
      potentially suggest a new mechanism for p53-dependent apoptosis.

TI  - The molecular mechanism of mitotic inhibition of TFIIH is mediated by
      phosphorylation of CDK7.
PG  - 3541-50
AB  - TFIIH is a multisubunit complex, containing ATPase, helicases, and kinase
      activities. Functionally, TFIIH has been implicated in transcription by RNA
      polymerase II (RNAPII) and in nucleotide excision repair. A member of the
      cyclin-dependent kinase family, CDK7, is the kinase subunit of TFIIH.
      Genetically, CDK7 homologues have been implicated in transcription in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in mitotic regulation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
      Here we show that in mitosis the CDK7 subunit of TFIIH and the largest subunit of
      RNAPII become hyperphosphorylated. MPF-induced phosphorylation of CDK7 results in
      inhibition of the TFIIH-associated kinase and transcription activities. Negative 
      and positive regulation of TFIIH requires phosphorylation within the T-loop of
      CDK7. Our data establishes TFIIH and its subunit CDK7 as a direct link between
      the regulation of transcription and the cell cycle.

TI  - A Ras-dependent pathway regulates RNA polymerase II phosphorylation in cardiac
      myocytes: implications for cardiac hypertrophy.
PG  - 6729-36
AB  - Despite extensive evidence implicating Ras in cardiac muscle hypertrophy, the
      mechanisms involved are unclear. We previously reported that Ras, through an
      effector-like function of Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) in neonatal cardiac
      myocytes (M. Abdellatif et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:15423-15426, 1994; M.
      Abdellatif and M. D. Schneider, J. Biol. Chem. 272:527-533, 1997), can
      up-regulate expression from a comprehensive set of promoters, including both
      cardiac cell-specific and constitutive ones. To investigate the mechanism(s)
      underlying these earlier findings, we have used recombinant adenoviruses
      harboring a dominant negative Ras (17N Ras) allele or the N-terminal domain of
      GAP (nGAP), responsible for the Ras-like effector function. Inhibition of
      endogenous Ras reduced basal levels of [3H]uridine and [3H]phenylalanine
      incorporation into total RNA, mRNA, and protein, with parallel changes in
      apparent cell size. In addition, 17N Ras markedly inhibited phosphorylation of
      the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (pol II), known to regulate
      transcript elongation, accompanied by down-regulation of its principal kinase,
      cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7). In contrast, nGAP elicited the opposite effects
      on each of these parameters. Furthermore, cotransfection of constitutively active
      Ras (12R Ras) with wild-type pol II, rather than a truncated mutant lacking the
      CTD, demonstrated that Ras activation of transcription was dependent on the pol
      II CTD. Consistent with a potential role for this pathway in the development of
      cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, alpha1-adrenergic stimulation similarly enhanced pol
      II phosphorylation and Cdk7 expression, where both effects were inhibited by
      dominant negative Ras, while pressure overload hypertrophy led to an increase in 
      both hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated pol II in addition to Cdk7.

TI  - Activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in growth-stimulated rat
      astrocytes. Geranylgeranylated Rho small GTPase(s) are essential for the
      induction of cyclin E gene expression.
PG  - 26772-8
AB  - The role of the mevalonate cascade in the control of cell cycle progression in
      astrocytes has been investigated. Serum stimulation of rat astrocytes in primary 
      culture induces the expression of cyclin E followed by the activation of
      cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) during G1/S transition. The expression of p27,
      cyclin D1, and the activities of Cdk4 and Cdk-activating kinase (CAK), composed
      of Cdk7 and cyclin H, were not affected. Serum did, however, stimulate the
      expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA at mid-G1
      phase. Moreover, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, pravastatin, reduced cyclin E
      expression and Cdk2 activation and caused G1 arrest in the astrocytes. In
      contrast, mevalonate and its metabolite, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) but
      not farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), reversed the inhibitory effects of pravastatin
      on cyclin E expression and Cdk2 activation and allowed G1/S transition. Rho small
      GTPase(s) were geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes in the presence
      of GGPP during G1/S transition. The effect of GGPP on cyclin E expression was
      abolished by botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates Rho. These
      data indicate that geranylgeranylated Rho small GTPase(s) are essential for the
      induction of cyclin E expression, Cdk2 activation, and G1/S transition in rat
      astrocytes.

TI  - Phosphorylation of nuclear MyoD is required for its rapid degradation.
PG  - 4994-9
AB  - MyoD is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in the activation 
      of genes encoding skeletal muscle-specific proteins. Independent of its ability
      to transactivate muscle-specific genes, MyoD can also act as a cell cycle
      inhibitor. MyoD activity is regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional 
      mechanisms. While MyoD can be found phosphorylated, the functional significance
      of this posttranslation modification has not been established. MyoD contains
      several consensus cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation sites. In these
      studies, we examined whether a link could be established between MyoD activity
      and phosphorylation at putative CDK sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential
      CDK phosphorylation sites in MyoD revealed that S200 is required for MyoD
      hyperphosphorylation as well as the normally short half-life of the MyoD protein.
      Additionally, we determined that turnover of the MyoD protein requires the
      proteasome and Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity. Results of these
      studies demonstrate that hyperphosphorylated MyoD is targeted for rapid
      degradation by the ubiquitin pathway. The targeted degradation of MyoD following 
      CDK phosphorylation identifies a mechanism through which MyoD activity can be
      regulated coordinately with the cell cycle machinery (CDK2 and CDK4) and/or
      coordinately with the cellular transcriptional machinery (CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9).

TI  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated antiestrogenicity in MCF-7 cells: modulation
      of hormone-induced cell cycle enzymes.
PG  - 239-48
AB  - 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) inhibits 17beta-estradiol (E2) mammary
      tumor growth in rodents and in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells; however, the cell
      cycle genes/proteins which are inhibited have not been determined. Initial
      studies showed that treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 nM E2 significantly
      increased cyclin D1 (protein and mRNA), cdk2- and cdk4-dependent kinase
      activities, and hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein. In contrast 
      to results of recent studies (M. D. Planas-Silva and R. A. Weinberg, 1997, Mol.
      Cell. Biol. 17, 4059-4069), E2 induced dissociation of both cdk2 and cdk4
      proteins from the p21 protein complex and significantly increased cdk7-dependent 
      kinase activity. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with E2 also induced cdc25A phosphatase
      protein, which was accompanied by increased cdk2 and cdk4 proteins containing
      unphosphorylated tyrosine residues. Although TCDD alone has minimal effects on
      cell cycle proteins/enzymes, several E2-induced responses were significantly
      inhibited in MCF-7 cells cotreated with E2 plus TCDD. For example, TCDD
      significantly inhibited E2-induced hyperphosphorylation of RB, cyclin D1 protein,
      and cdk2-, cdk4-, and cdk7-dependent kinase activities. Inhibition of E2-induced 
      cdk4-dependent kinase activity by TCDD may be related to the parallel decrease of
      E2-induced cyclin D1 protein, and inhibition of induced cdk2- and cdk4-dependent 
      kinase activities may be due to significantly increased p21 levels in cells
      cotreated with TCDD plus E2. These results demonstrate that the antiestrogenic
      activity of TCDD is due to downregulation of several E2-induced cell cycle
      proteins/activities and this illustrates the complex cross talk between the aryl 
      hydrocarbon and the E2 receptor signaling pathways.

TI  - The ability of positive transcription elongation factor B to transactivate human 
      immunodeficiency virus transcription depends on a functional kinase domain,
      cyclin T1, and Tat.
PG  - 7154-9
AB  - By binding to the transactivation response element (TAR) RNA, the transcriptional
      transactivator (Tat) from the human immunodeficiency virus increases rates of
      elongation rather than initiation of viral transcription. Two cyclin-dependent
      serine/threonine kinases, CDK7 and CDK9, which phosphorylate the C-terminal
      domain of RNA polymerase II, have been implicated in Tat transactivation in vivo 
      and in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that CDK9, which is the kinase
      component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, can
      activate viral transcription when tethered to the heterologous Rev response
      element RNA via the regulator of expression of virion proteins (Rev). The kinase 
      activity of CDK9 and cyclin T1 is essential for these effects. Moreover, P-TEFb
      binds to TAR only in the presence of Tat. We conclude that Tat-P-TEFb complexes
      bind to TAR, where CDK9 modifies RNA polymerase II for the efficient copying of
      the viral genome.

TI  - Heat-shock-specific phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of RNA
      polymerase II.
PG  - 211-21
AB  - The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II (pol II)
      subunit is a target for extensive phosphorylation in vivo. Using in vitro kinase 
      assays it was found that several different protein kinases can phosphorylate the 
      CTD including the transcription factor IIH-associated CDK-activating CDK7 kinase 
      (R. Roy, J. P. Adamczewski, T. Seroz, W. Vermeulen, J. P. Tassan, L. Schaeffer,
      E. A. Nigg, J. H. Hoeijmakers, and J. M. Egly, 1994, Cell 79, 1093-1101). Here we
      report the colocalization of CDK7 and the phosphorylated form of CTD (phosphoCTD)
      to actively transcribing genes in intact salivary gland cells of Chironomus
      tentans. Following a heat-shock treatment, both CDK7 and pol II staining
      disappear from non-heat-shock genes concomitantly with the abolishment of
      transcriptional activity of these genes. In contrast, the actively transcribing
      heat-shock genes, manifested as chromosomal puff 5C on chromosome IV (IV-5C),
      stain intensely for phosphoCTD, but are devoid of CDK7. Furthermore, the staining
      of puff IV-5C with anti-PCTD antibodies was not detectably influenced by the
      TFIIH kinase and transcription inhibitor
      5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). Following heat-shock
      treatment, the transcription of non-heat-shock genes was completely eliminated,
      while newly formed heat-shock gene transcripts emerged in a DRB-resistant manner.
      Thus, heat shock in these cells induces a rapid clearance of CDK7 from the
      non-heat-shock genes, indicating a lack of involvement of CDK7 in the induction
      and function of the heat-induced genes. The results taken together suggest the
      existence of heat-shock-specific CTD phosphorylation in living cells. This
      phosphorylation is resistant to DRB treatment, suggesting that not only
      phosphorylation but also transcription of heat-shock genes is DRB resistant and
      that CDK7 in heat shock cells is not associated with TFIIH.

TI  - Expression of second messenger- and cyclin-dependent protein kinases during
      postnatal development of rat heart.
PG  - 506-21
AB  - During early postnatal development, cardiomyocytes, which comprise about 80% of
      ventricular mass and volume, become phenotypically developed to facilitate their 
      contractile functions and terminally differentiated to grow only in size but not 
      in cell number. These changes are due to the expression of contractile proteins
      as well as the regulation of intracellular signal transduction proteins. In this 
      study, the expression patterns of several protein kinases involved in various
      cardiac functions and cell-cycle control were analyzed by Western blotting of
      ventricular extracts from 1-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 365-day-old rats. The expression
      level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was slightly decreased (20%) over the
      first year, whereas no change was detected in cGMP-dependent protein kinase I.
      Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which is involved in Ca2+ uptake into the
      sarcoplasmic reticulum, was increased as much as ten-fold. To the contrary, the
      expressions of protein kinase C-alpha and iota declined 77% with age.
      Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK5, which
      are required for cell-cycle progression, abruptly declined to almost undetectable
      levels after 10-20 days of age. In contrast, other CDK-related kinases, such as
      CDK8 or Kkialre, did not change significantly or increased up to 50% with age,
      respectively. Protein kinases implicated in CDK regulation such as CDK7 and Wee1 
      were either slightly increased in expression or did not change significantly. All
      of the proteins that were detected in ventricular extracts were also identified
      in isolated cardiac myocytes in equivalent amounts and analyzed for their
      relative expression in ten other adult rat tissues.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the levels of the different regulatory proteins involved 
      in the G1 progression and G1/S transition in normal and transformed human
      choroidal melanocytes (CM). METHODS: Three choroidal melanoma cell lines and
      three CM cultures were used. The purity of the CM cultures was assessed by
      different approaches, including morphologic study, specific immunostaining, cell 
      proliferation behavior, and transforming growth factor-beta1 responsiveness. The 
      cell cycle protein levels were evaluated by specific immunoblotting of total
      extracts obtained from the different cell lines. RESULTS: Alterations were
      observed in the expression of cylins D1 and E in the transformed cells, whereas
      the amounts of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) CDK2 and CDK4 were almost
      identical in both cell types. Although the expression of cyclin H was slightly
      increased in transformed cells, neither the CDK7 level nor the CDK7 and cyclin H 
      localizations were altered when compared with those in normal CM. The results
      suggest the absence of the CDK inhibitor (CKI) p21 in two of the three melanoma
      cell lines and, as a main feature, a striking underexpression of p27 in the three
      transformed cell lines. Finally, although the p16 level was almost the same in
      normal and transformed cells, a loss of p16-CDK4 interaction was observed in two 
      of the three melanoma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Deregulated expression of G1
      cyclins and CKIs and alteration in the interaction of CKIs with CDKs may be
      implicated in the neoplastic transformation of human ocular melanocytes to
      malignant melanoma cells.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4A inhibits phosphorylation of RNA
      polymerase II by general transcription factor TFIIH.
PG  - 5427-30
AB  - The cell cycle is regulated by various protein kinases, including
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). D-type CDKs, CDK4, and CDK6, phosphorylate
      retinoblastoma protein and are believed to regulate through the G1 phase of the
      cell cycle. CDK inhibitor p16INK4A has been characterized as binding CDK4 and
      CDK6 and as inhibiting phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by these CDKs.
      Thus p16INK4A is implicated in regulating the cell cycle at the G1 phase. The
      largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) contains an essential C-terminal
      domain (CTD). General transcription factor TFIIH, which contains CDK7,
      phosphorylates the CTD in vitro. The CTD phosphorylation is shown to be involved 
      in transcriptional regulation in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of RNA pol II
      CTD by TFIIH is thought to play an important role in transcriptional regulation. 
      Here we report that p16INK4A associates with RNA pol II CTD and TFIIH. p16(INK4A)
      inhibited the CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH. These findings suggest that p16INK4A 
      may regulate transcription via CTD phosphorylation in the cell cycle.

TI  - Changes in cyclin B during oocyte maturation and early embryonic cell cycle in
      the newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster: requirement of germinal vesicle for MPF
      activation.
PG  - 60-9
AB  - When full-grown oocytes of the newt Cynops pyrrhogaster were treated with
      progesterone in O-R2 solution containing antibiotics, approximately 85% of the
      oocytes completed meiosis synchronously. Maturation-promoting factor (MPF)
      activity appeared just before germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and the oocytes
      maintained high MPF activity throughout metaphase I and metaphase II of meiosis. 
      A slight decrease of MPF activity was observed at the first polar body emission. 
      The distribution of cyclin B1 was investigated with anti-cyclin B1 antibody. No
      cyclin B1 was found in the oocytes before progesterone treatment. Cyclin B1
      appeared in the cortex of animal hemispheres, especially around and inside
      germinal vesicle just before GVBD. A large amount of cyclin B1 accumulated at
      metaphase I, approximately half disappeared at the first polar body emission, and
      then cyclin B1 accumulated again at metaphase II. An inactive form of cdc2 kinase
      was observed in both the germinal vesicles and the oocyte cytoplasm, while an
      active form appeared at the M phase. No MPF was observed in the oocytes from
      which the germinal vesicle had been removed. A cdk7-like molecule was localized
      in the germinal vesicle, but not in oocyte cytoplasm, indicating that inactive
      cdc2 kinase associated with cyclin B1 derived from cytoplasm is activated by
      phosphorylation in the germinal vesicle. The changes in the amount of cyclin B1
      were synchronous with the first cell cycle after fertilization. Cyclin B1 was
      primarily localized in the cortex of the animal hemisphere. A shift in band
      mobility upon electrophoresis of cyclin B1 was observed from samples taken during
      the cell cycle; this shift was probably due to the protein's phosphorylation
      state.

TI  - Repression of TFIIH transcriptional activity and TFIIH-associated cdk7 kinase
      activity at mitosis.
PG  - 1467-76
AB  - Nuclear transcription is repressed when eukaryotic cells enter mitosis. Mitotic
      repression of transcription of various cellular and viral gene promoters by RNA
      polymerase II can be reproduced in vitro either with extracts prepared from cells
      arrested at mitosis with the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole or
      with nuclear extracts prepared from asynchronous cells and the mitotic protein
      kinase cdc2/cyclin B. Purified cdc2/cyclin B kinase is also sufficient to inhibit
      transcription in reconstituted transcription reactions with biochemically
      purified and recombinant basal transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. The
      cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 can reverse the effect of
      cdc2/cyclin B kinase, indicating that repression of transcription is due to
      protein phosphorylation. Transcription rescue and inhibition experiments with
      each of the basal factors and the polymerase suggest that multiple components of 
      the transcription machinery are inactivated by cdc2/cyclin B kinase. For an
      activated promoter, targets of repression are TFIID and TFIIH, while for a basal 
      promoter, TFIIH is the major target for mitotic inactivation of transcription.
      Protein labeling experiments indicate that the p62 and p36 subunits of TFIIH are 
      in vitro substrates for mitotic phosphorylation. Using the carboxy-terminal
      domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II as a test substrate for
      phosphorylation, the TFIIH-associated kinase, cdk7/cyclin H, is inhibited
      concomitant with inhibition of transcription activity. Our results suggest that
      there exist multiple phosphorylation targets for the global shutdown of
      transcription at mitosis.

TI  - Cdk7 is essential for mitosis and for in vivo Cdk-activating kinase activity.
PG  - 370-81
AB  - Cdk7 has been shown previously to be able to phosphorylate and activate many
      different Cdks in vitro. However, conclusive evidence that Cdk7 acts as a
      Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) in vivo has remained elusive. Adding to the
      controversy is the fact that in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CAK
      activity is provided by the CAK1/Civ1 protein, which is unrelated to Cdk7.
      Furthermore Kin28, the budding yeast Cdk7 homolog, functions not as a CAK but as 
      the catalytic subunit of TFIIH. Vertebrate Cdk7 is also known to be part of
      TFIIH. Therefore, in the absence of better genetic evidence, it was proposed that
      the CAK activity of Cdk7 may be an in vitro artifact. In an attempt to resolve
      this issue, we cloned the Drosophila cdk7 homolog and created null and
      temperature-sensitive mutations. Here we demonstrate that cdk7 is necessary for
      CAK activity in vivo in a multicellular organism. We show that cdk7 activity is
      required for the activation of both Cdc2/Cyclin A and Cdc2/Cyclin B complexes,
      and for cell division. These results suggest that there may be a fundamental
      difference in the way metazoans and budding yeast effect a key modification of
      Cdks.

TI  - Mapping of the human genes encoding cyclin H (CCNH) and the CDK-activating kinase
      (CAK) assembly factor MAT1 (MNAT1) to chromosome bands 5q13.3-q14 and 14q23,
      respectively.
PG  - 115-20
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which play a key role in cell cycle control, are
      activated by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which activates cyclin-bound CDKs
      by phosphorylation at the specific threonine residue. Mammalian CAK contains
      three components: CDK7, cyclin H, and an assembly factor called MAT1. The
      CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex is tightly associated with a multiprotein complex
      TFIIH, which plays a dual role in transcription and DNA repair. Here, we have
      determined chromosomal localizations of the human genes encoding cyclin H (CCNH) 
      and MAT1 (HGMW-approved symbol MNAT1) to chromosome bands 5q13.3-q14 and 14q23,
      respectively, by using fluorescence in situ hybridization, somatic cell hybrid
      analyses, and mapping to the human YAC contigs.

TI  - p53 is phosphorylated by CDK7-cyclin H in a p36MAT1-dependent manner.
PG  - 7220-9
AB  - The tumor suppressor protein p53 acts as a transcriptional activator that can
      mediate cellular responses to DNA damage by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle
      arrest. p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation has been proposed to
      be a means by which the activity of p53 is regulated. The cyclin-dependent kinase
      (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) was originally identified as a cellular kinase
      required for the activation of a CDK-cyclin complex, and CAK is comprised of
      three subunits: CDK7, cyclin H, and p36MAT1. CAK is part of the transcription
      factor IIH multiprotein complex, which is required for RNA polymerase II
      transcription and nucleotide excision repair. Because of the similarities between
      p53 and CAK in their involvement in the cell cycle, transcription, and repair, we
      investigated whether p53 could act as a substrate for phosphorylation by CAK.
      While CDK7-cyclin H is sufficient for phosphorylation of CDK2, we show that
      p36MAT1 is required for efficient phosphorylation of p53 by CDK7-cyclin H,
      suggesting that p36MAT1 can act as a substrate specificity-determining factor for
      CDK7-cyclin H. We have mapped a major site of phosphorylation by CAK to Ser-33 of
      p53 and have demonstrated as well that p53 is phosphorylated at this site in
      vivo. Both wild-type and tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins are efficiently
      phosphorylated by CAK. Furthermore, we show that p36 and p53 can interact both in
      vitro and in vivo. These studies reveal a potential mechanism for coupling the
      regulation of p53 with DNA repair and the basal transcriptional machinery.

TI  - The cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK) assembly factor, MAT1,
      targets and enhances CAK activity on the POU domains of octamer transcription
      factors.
PG  - 29852-8
AB  - Octamer binding transcription factors (Oct factors) play important roles in
      activation of transcription of various genes but, in some cases, require
      cofactors that interact with the DNA binding (POU) domain. In the present study, 
      a yeast two-hybrid screen with the Oct-1 POU domain as a bait identified MAT1 as 
      a POU domain-binding protein. MAT1 is known to be required for the assembly of
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK), which is functionally
      associated with the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). Further analyses
      showed that MAT1 interacts with POU domains of Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oct-3 in vitro
      in a DNA-independent manner. MAT1-containing TFIIH was also shown to interact
      with POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2. MAT1 is shown to enhance the ability of a
      recombinant CDK7-cyclin H complex (bipartite CAK) to phosphorylate isolated POU
      domains, intact Oct-1, and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, but not
      the originally defined substrate, CDK2. Phosphopeptide mapping indicates that the
      site (Ser385) of a mitosis-specific phosphorylation that inhibits Oct-1 binding
      to DNA is not phosphorylated by CAK. However, one CAK-phosphorylated
      phosphopeptide comigrates with a Cdc2-phosphorylated phosphopeptide previously
      shown to be mitosis-specific, suggesting that, in vitro, CAK is able to
      phosphorylate at least one site that is also phosphorylated in vivo. These
      results suggest (i) that interactions between POU domains and MAT1 can target CAK
      to Oct factors and result in their phosphorylation, (ii) that MAT1 not only
      functions as a CAK assembly factor but also acts to alter the spectrum of CAK
      substrates, and (iii) that a POU-MAT1 interaction may play a role in the
      recruitment of TFIIH to the preinitiation complex or in subsequent initiation and
      elongation reactions.

TI  - The HIV transactivator TAT binds to the CDK-activating kinase and activates the
      phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 2645-57
AB  - The human immunodeficiency virus encodes the transcriptional transactivator Tat, 
      which binds to the transactivation response (TAR) RNA stem-loop in the viral long
      terminal repeat (LTR) and increases rates of elongation rather than initiation of
      transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In this study, we demonstrate that
      Tat binds directly to the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), which leads to
      productive interactions between Tat and the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex
      and between Tat and TFIIH. Tat activates the phosphorylation of the
      carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II by CAK in vitro. The ability of CAK to
      phosphorylate the CTD can be inhibited specifically by a CDK7 pseudosubstrate
      peptide that also inhibits transcriptional activation by Tat in vitro and in
      vivo. We conclude that the phosphorylation of the CTD by CAK is essential for Tat
      transactivation. Our data identify a cellular protein that interacts with the
      activation domain of Tat, demonstrate that this interaction is critical for the
      function of Tat, and provide a mechanism by which Tat increases the processivity 
      of Pol II.

TI  - Introduction of cyclin B induces activation of the maturation-promoting factor
      and breakdown of germinal vesicle in growing zebrafish oocytes unresponsive to
      the maturation-inducing hormone.
PG  - 142-52
AB  - When treated with 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17alpha,20beta-DP), a
      natural maturation-inducing hormone in fishes, fully grown zebrafish oocytes are 
      induced to mature via the activation of the maturation-promoting factor (MPF),
      which consists of cdc2 (a catalytic subunit) and cyclin B (a regulatory subunit).
      In contrast, 17alpha,20beta-DP is unable to induce growing (previtellogenic and
      vitellogenic) oocytes to mature. To know the reason growing oocytes fail to
      mature upon 17alpha,20beta-DP treatment, we investigated changes in the
      components of machinery responsible for MPF activation during zebrafish
      oogenesis. Immunoblotting experiments using monoclonal antibodies against cdc2,
      cyclin B, and cdk7 (an activator of cdc2) have revealed that the concentrations
      of cdc2 and cdk7 are almost constant during oogenesis. Cyclin B was present in
      mature oocytes but absent in growing and fully grown immature oocytes. These
      results, which are identical to those in goldfish, strongly suggest that cyclin B
      is synthesized from stored (masked) mRNA after 17alpha,20beta-DP stimulation and 
      that its binding to the preexisting cdc2 allows cdk7 to activate MPF.
      Microinjection of cyclin B protein induced MPF activation and germinal vesicle
      breakdown in growing oocytes, as well as in fully grown oocytes, indicating that 
      cdk7 present in growing oocytes is already active. Northern blot analysis
      revealed the presence of cyclin B mRNA in both previtellogenic and fully grown
      oocytes. These results indicate that, as in fully grown oocytes, growing oocytes 
      are already equipped with the catalytic subunit of MPF (cdc2) and its activator
      (cdk7) and that the appearance of the regulatory subunit of MPF (cyclin B) is
      sufficient for initiating maturation. Therefore, the unresponsiveness of growing 
      oocytes to 17alpha,20beta-DP is attributable to a deficiency in the processes
      leading to cyclin B synthesis, which include 17alpha,20beta-DP reception on the
      oocyte surface, subsequent signal transduction pathways, and unmasking the stored
      cyclin B mRNA.

TI  - The CDK7-cycH-p36 complex of transcription factor IIH phosphorylates p53,
      enhancing its sequence-specific DNA binding activity in vitro.
PG  - 5923-34
AB  - Phosphorylation is believed to be one of the mechanisms by which p53 becomes
      activated or stabilized in response to cellular stress. Previously, p53 was shown
      to interact with three components of transcription factor IIH (TFIIH): excision
      repair cross-complementing types 2 and 3 (ERCC2 and ERCC3) and p62. This
      communication demonstrates that p53 is phosphorylated by the TFIIH-associated
      kinase in vitro. The phosphorylation was found to be catalyzed by the highly
      purified kinase components of TFIIH, the CDK7-cycH-p36 trimeric complex. The
      phosphorylation sites were mapped to the C-terminal amino acids located between
      residues 311 and 393. Serines 371, 376, 378, and 392 may be the potential sites
      for this kinase. Phosphorylation of p53 by this kinase complex enhanced the
      ability of p53 to bind to the sequence-specific p53-responsive DNA element as
      shown by gel mobility shift assays. These results suggest that the CDK7-cycH-p36 
      trimeric complex of TFIIH may play a role in regulating p53 functions in cells.

TI  - Is Cdk7/cyclin H/MAT1 the genuine cdk activating kinase in cycling Xenopus egg
      extracts?
PG  - 1303-7
AB  - Formation of active cdk (cyclin dependent kinase)/ cyclin kinases involves
      phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the T loop of the cdk
      catalytic-subunit by CAK (Cdk Activating Kinase). CAK was first purified
      biochemically from higher eukaryotes and identified as a trimeric complex
      containing a cdk7 catalytic subunit, cyclin H and MAT1 (Menage a trois), a member
      of the RING finger family. The same trimeric complex is also part of basal
      transcription factor TFIIH. In budding yeast, the closest homologs of cdk7 and
      cyclin H, KIN28 and CCL1, respectively, also associate with TFIIH. However, the
      KIN28/CCL1 complex does not display CAK activity and a distinct protein kinase
      able to phosphorylate monomeric CDC28 and GST-cdk2 was recently identified,
      challenging the identification of cdk7 as the physiological CAK in higher
      eukaryotes. Here we demonstrate that immunodepletion of cdk7 suppresses CAK
      activity from cycling Xenopus egg extracts, and arrest them before M-phase. We
      also show that specific translation of mRNAs encoding Xenopus cdk7 and its
      associated subunits restores CAK activity in cdk7-immunodepleted Xenopus egg
      extracts. Hence, the cdk7 complex is necessary and sufficient for activation of
      cdk-cyclin complexes in cycling Xenopus egg extracts.

TI  - A human primary T-lymphocyte-derived human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      Tat-associated kinase phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II
      and induces CAK activity.
PG  - 7436-41
AB  - Tat protein mediates transactivation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      (HIV-1), which results in more-efficient transcript elongation. Since
      phosphorylation of C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II correlates with
      its enhanced processivity, we studied the properties of a Tat-associated CTD
      kinase derived from mitogenically stimulated human primary T lymphocytes (TTK).
      TTK binds to full-length Tat and specifically phosphorylates CTD and CDK2. This
      dual kinase activity is characteristic of CDK-activating kinase (CAK). The CTD
      kinase activity is induced upon mitogenic stimulation of primary T lymphocytes.
      Fractionation of T-cell lysate demonstrates that Tat-associated CTD kinase
      activity elutes in two peaks. About 60% of Tat-associated CTD kinase copurifies
      with CDK2 kinase activity and contains the CAK components CDK7 and cyclin H. The 
      rest of Tat-associated kinase is free of CDK2 kinase activity and the CAK
      components and thus may represent a novel CTD kinase. The kinase activities of
      TTK are blocked by the adenosine analog
      5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) as well as by the kinase 
      inhibitor H8 at concentrations known to block transcript elongation. Importantly,
      the Tat-associated kinase markedly induced CAK. We suggest that the mechanism of 
      Tat-mediated processive transcription of the HIV-1 promoter includes a
      Tat-associated CAK activator.

TI  - Regulation of estrogen receptor transcriptional enhancement by the cyclin A/Cdk2 
      complex.
PG  - 10132-7
AB  - We have found that ectopic expression of cyclin A increases hormone-dependent and
      hormone-independent transcriptional activation by the estrogen receptor in vivo
      in a number of cell lines, including HeLa cells, U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells and Hs
      578Bst breast epithelial cells. This effect can be further enhanced in HeLa cells
      by the concurrent expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase activator, cyclin H, 
      and cdk7, and abolished by expression of the cdk inhibitor, p27(KIP1), or by the 
      expression of a dominant negative catalytically inactive cdk2 mutant. ER is
      phosphorylated between amino acids 82 and 121 in vitro by the cyclin A/cdk2
      complex and incorporation of phosphate into ER is stimulated by ectopic
      expression of cyclin A in vivo. Together, these results strongly suggest a direct
      role for the cyclin A/cdk2 complex in phosphorylating ER and regulating its
      transcriptional activity.

TI  - A conditionally expressed third partner stabilizes or prevents the formation of a
      transcriptional activator in a three-hybrid system.
PG  - 22995-9
AB  - We describe a three-hybrid system that involves three polypeptides that allow or 
      prevent the formation of the transcriptional activator. Beside the two-hybrid
      fusion proteins, the third partner is under the control of the Met25 promoter,
      which is positively regulated in medium lacking methionine. We document a
      situation where such a third partner promotes interaction between two proteins,
      one fused to a DNA-binding domain and the other fused to an activator domain.
      This is demonstrated for cdk7-MAT1 interaction stabilized by the presence of
      cyclin H; these three polypeptides are found either free or associated with the
      transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH. We also document the capacity of our
      system to conditionally inhibit the interaction between two polypeptides that
      otherwise elicit a positive two-hybrid response. This is demonstrated for Ras-Raf
      interaction precluded by an excess of Raf. The presence of a methionine-regulated
      promoter provides an "on" or "off" switch for the formation of the
      transcriptional activator, thus also providing an excellent control to evaluate
      the activation or inhibition properties of the third partner.

TI  - Rig2, a RING finger protein that interacts with the Kin28/Ccl1 CTD kinase in
      yeast.
PG  - 460-6
AB  - Kin28/Cell, a cyclin-dependent kinase, is essential for the in vivo
      phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase
      II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a search for mutations co-lethal with a
      thermosensitive kin28 mutation, we have identified genes whose products interact 
      functionally with Kin28. In the present work, we have studied a new
      complementation group of synthetic lethal mutations. The corresponding gene,
      RIG2, encodes a predicted RING finger protein. Rig2 is likely to be a homolog of 
      MAT1 of higher eukaryotes which forms a ternary complex with MO15(cdk7) and
      cyclin H. Our genetic data suggest that Rig2 is a component of transcription
      factor TFIIH. Transcription activity in a rig2-ts mutant is impeded at
      restrictive temperature. However, none of the rig2-ts mutants obtained was UV
      sensitive, suggesting that Rig2 is dispensable for nucleotide excision repair.

TI  - Myofibrillar myopathy. III. Abnormal expression of cyclin-dependent kinases and
      nuclear proteins.
PG  - 850-6
AB  - The pathological process in myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) (previously also referred
      to as "desmin storage" or "intermediate filament myopathy") results in
      dissolution of myofibrils, accumulation of products of the degradative process,
      and abnormal ectopic expression of desmin, dystrophin, gelsolin, NCAM, and
      N-terminal components of beta-amyloid precursor protein. We now demonstrate that 
      the abnormal fiber regions in MFM immunoreact strongly for (a) CDC2 kinase, the
      mitotic kinase that phosphorylates and disassembles intermediate filaments; (b)
      cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2, CDK4, and CDK7, which are involved in regulation
      of the cell cycle; (c) lamin B, which normally supports the inner nuclear
      membrane; and (d) the nuclear matrix associated protein. The normal muscle fiber 
      lies in a terminally differentiated state and is refractory to reentry into the
      cell cycle. The abnormal expression of multiple cyclin-dependent kinases in the
      terminally differentiated muscle fiber implies inappropriate activation of
      positive regulators of mitosis and may signal a mitotic catastrophe. The
      dissolution of myofibrils may be due to hyperphosphorylation occurring during
      this event.

TI  - Stimulation of RAR alpha activation function AF-1 through binding to the general 
      transcription factor TFIIH and phosphorylation by CDK7.
PG  - 97-107
AB  - The activity of the N-terminal activation function AF-1 of RAR alpha1 is
      abrogated upon mutation of a phosphorylatable serine residue (Ser-77).
      Recombinant RAR alpha was phosphorylated by a variety of proline-directed protein
      kinases in vitro. However, only the coexpression of cdk7 stimulated Ser-77
      phosphorylation in vivo and enhanced transactivation by RAR alpha, but not by a
      S77A RAR mutant. Both free CAK (cdk7, cyclin H, MAT1) and the CAK-containing
      general transcription factor TFIIH phosphorylated Ser-77 in vitro. Furthermore
      RAR alpha bound free CAK and purified TFIIH in vitro, and RAR alpha-TFIIH
      complexes could be isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts. These findings represent 
      the first example of activation of a transactivator through binding to and
      phosphorylation by a general transcription factor.

TI  - The cdk7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex associated with TFIIH is localized in coiled
      bodies.
PG  - 1207-17
AB  - TFIIH is a general transcription factor for RNA polymerase II that in addition is
      involved in DNA excision repair. TFIIH is composed of eight or nine subunits and 
      we show that at least four of them, namely cdk7, cyclin H, MAT1, and p62 are
      localized in the coiled body, a distinct subnuclear structure that is
      transcription dependent and highly enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. 
      Although coiled bodies do not correspond to sites of transcription, in vivo
      incorporation of bromo-UTP shows that they are surrounded by transcription foci. 
      Immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against the essential
      repair factors proliferating cell nuclear antigen and XPG did not reveal labeling
      of the coiled body in either untreated cells or cells irradiated with UV light,
      arguing that coiled bodies are probably not involved in DNA repair mechanisms.
      The localization of cyclin H in the coiled body was predominantly detected during
      the G1 and S-phases of the cell cycle, whereas in G2 coiled bodies were very
      small or not detected. Finally, both cyclin H and cdk7 did not colocalize with
      P80 coilin after disruption of the coiled body, indicating that these proteins
      are specifically targeted to the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-containing
      domain.

TI  - Interactions of cyclins with cyclin-dependent kinases: a common interactive
      mechanism.
PG  - 4995-5003
AB  - The formation of cdk-cyclin complexes has been investigated at the molecular
      level and quantified using spectroscopic approaches. In the absence of
      phosphorylation, cdk2, cdc2, and cdk7 form highly stable complexes with their
      "natural" cyclin partners with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. In 
      contrast, nonphosphorylated cdc2-cyclin H, cdk2-cyclin H, and cdk7-cyclin A
      complexes present a 25-fold lower stability. On the basis of both the structure
      of the cdk2-cyclin A complex and on our kinetic results, we suggest that
      interaction of any cyclin with any cdk involves the same hydrophobic contacts and
      induces a marked conformational change in the catalytic cleft of the cdks.
      Although cdks bind ATP strongly, they remain in a catalytically inactive
      conformation. In contrast, binding of the cyclin induces structural
      rearrangements which result in the selective reorientation of ATP, a concomitant 
      3-fold increase in its affinity, and a 5-fold decrease of its release from the
      active site of cdks.

TI  - Translocation of cdk2 to the nucleus during G1-phase in PDGF-stimulated human
      fibroblasts.
PG  - 72-8
AB  - We studied the subcellular distribution of cdk2 in synchronized, PDGF-stimulated 
      human fibroblasts (FH109). After contact inhibition and serum depletion, more
      than 95% of FH109 cells were arrested in G0/G1-phase. PDGF-AB led to a 16-fold
      increase in proliferation compared with untreated cells. Cell cycle progression
      was studied by flow cytometric analysis, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and
      phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product, pRB. Using Western blot
      analysis after subcellular fractionation, we revealed that after PDGF stimulation
      the phosphorylated (Thr 160), i.e., activated, form of cdk2 (33 kDa) first
      appeared in the nucleus at late G1-phase and persisted throughout until to the
      end of S-phase. Since cdk2 was not synthesized de novo, and the amount of
      inactive cdk2 (35 kDa) remained constant in the nucleus, we suggested a
      translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus in late G1. Using
      immunofluorescence techniques, we detected a diffuse staining in quiescent cells.
      Starting at late G1-phase, cdk2 immunoreactivity was concentrated to the nucleus 
      while immunoreactivity in the cytosol disappeared. We therefore draw the
      conclusion that cdk2 is translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus in late
      G1-phase. Since protein levels and activity of cdk7, which is the catalytic
      subunit of cdk-activating kinase (CAK) phosphorylating cdk2, remained constant
      throughout the cell cycle, CAK activity might therefore be regulated by the
      availability of its substrate cdk2.

TI  - Contact inhibition-induced inactivation of the cyclin D-dependent kinase in rat
      fibroblast cell line, 3Y1.
PG  - 361-2
AB  - Inhibitory proteins for Cdks (CKIs) are involved in cell cycle arrest induced by 
      anti-mitotic factors, chemicals, or DNA damage in mammalian cells. High cell
      density also induces cell cycle arrest with unreplicated genomic DNA even in the 
      presence of mitotic dose of the growth factors, termed contact inhibition.
      Although rat fibroblast cell line, 3Y1, arrested in quiescence by contact
      inhibition, Cdk4 bound its regulatory subunit, cyclin D1 or D3. However, these
      complexes were enzymatically inactive. Phosphorylation of the cyclin D1-bound
      Cdk4 by Cdk4-activating kinase, composed of cyclin H and MO15 (alias Cdk7), which
      was reconstituted in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) could convert inactive
      cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex into active form in vitro, suggesting that threonine 172
      in the Cdk4, whose phosphorylation is required for its activation, was in part
      unphosphorylated in the contact-inhibited 3Y1. Although MO15 was active in cell
      extracts prepared from the contact-inhibited 3Y1, activation of bacterially
      produced Cdk4 in the cell extracts was inhibited. Removing p27kip1 from the cell 
      extracts allowed MO15 holoenzyme to phosphorylate the Cdk4 and to activate it,
      indicating that an access of MO15 to Cdk4 was inhibited by p27kip1 in the
      contact-inhibited 3Y1.

TI  - Regulation of CDK7 substrate specificity by MAT1 and TFIIH.
PG  - 1638-46
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase CAK has been proposed to
      function in the control of cell cycle progression, DNA repair and RNA polymerase 
      II (pol II) transcription. Most CAK exists as complexes of three subunits: CDK7, 
      cyclin H (CycH) and MAT1. This tripartite CAK occurs in a free form and in
      association with 'core' TFIIH, which functions in both pol II transcription and
      DNA repair. We investigated the substrate specificities of different forms of
      CAK. Addition of the MAT1 subunit to recombinant bipartite CDK7-CycH switched its
      substrate preference to favour the pol II large subunit C-terminal domain (CTD)
      over CDK2. We suggest that the MAT1 protein, previously shown to function as an
      assembly factor for CDK7-CycH, also acts to modulate CAK substrate specificity.
      The substrate specificities of natural TFIIH and free CAK were also compared.
      TFIIH had a strong preference for the CTD over CDK2 relative to free CAK. TFIIH, 
      but not free CAK, could efficiently hyperphosphorylate the CTD. In the context of
      TFIIH, the kinase also acquired specificity for the general transcription factors
      TFIIE and TFIIF which were not recognized by free CAK. We conclude that the
      substrate preference of the CDK7-CycH kinase is governed by association with both
      MAT1 and 'core' TFIIH.

TI  - Substrate specificity of the cdk-activating kinase (CAK) is altered upon
      association with TFIIH.
PG  - 1628-37
AB  - The transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH consists of nine subunits, several
      exhibiting known functions: helicase/ATPase, kinase activity and DNA binding.
      Three subunits of TFIIH, cdk7, cyclin H and MAT1, form a ternary complex,
      cdk-activating kinase (CAK), found either on its own or as part of TFIIH. In the 
      present work, we demonstrate that purified human CAK complex (free CAK) and
      recombinant CAK (rCAK) produced in insect cells exhibit a strong preference for
      the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) over a ctd oligopeptide substrate (which
      mimics the carboxy-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II). In contrast, TFIIH 
      preferentially phosphorylates the ctd as well as TFIIE alpha, but not cdk2. TFIIH
      was resolved into four subcomplexes: the kinase complex composed of cdk7, cyclin 
      H and MAT1; the core TFIIH which contains XPB, p62, p52, p44 and p34; and two
      other subcomplexes in which XPD is found associated with either the kinase
      complex or with the core TFIIH. Using these fractions, we demonstrate that TFIIH 
      lacking the CAK subcomplex completely recovers its transcriptional activity in
      the presence of free CAK. Furthermore, studies examining the interactions between
      TFIIH subunits provide evidence that CAK is integrated within TFIIH via XPB and
      XPD.

TI  - The structure of cyclin H: common mode of kinase activation and specific
      features.
PG  - 958-67
AB  - The crystal structure of human cyclin H refined at 2.6 A resolution is compared
      with that of cyclin A. The core of the molecule consists of two repeats
      containing five helices each and forming the canonical cyclin fold also observed 
      in TFIIB. One hundred and thirty-two out of the 217 C alpha atoms from the cyclin
      fold can be superposed with a root-mean-square difference of 1.8 A. The
      structural homology is even higher for the residues at the interface with the
      kinase, which is of functional significance, as shown by our observation that
      cyclin H binds to cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) and that cyclin A is able to
      activate cdk7 in the presence of MAT1. Based on this superposition, a new
      signature sequence for cyclins was found. The specificity of the cyclin H
      molecule is provided mainly by two long helices which extend the cyclin fold at
      its N- and C-termini and pack together against the first repeat on the side
      opposite to the kinase. Deletion mutants show that the terminal helices are
      required for a functionally active cyclin H.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal repeat domain in RNA polymerase II by
      cyclin-dependent kinases is sufficient to inhibit transcription.
PG  - 390-402
AB  - Cdc2 kinase triggers the entry of mammalian cells into mitosis, the only cell
      cycle phase in which transcription is globally repressed. We show here that Cdc2 
      kinase phosphorylates components of the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery
      including the RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal repeat domain (CTD). To test
      specifically the effect of CTD phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase, we used a yeast in
      vitro transcription extract that is dependent on exogenous RNA polymerase II that
      contains a CTD. Phosphorylation was carried out using immobilized Cdc2 so that
      the kinase could be removed from the phosphorylated polymerase. ATP gamma S and
      Cdc2 kinase were used to produce an RNA polymerase IIO that was not detectably
      dephosphorylated in the transcription extract. RNA polymerase IIO produced in
      this way was defective in promoter-dependent transcription, suggesting that
      phosphorylation of the CTD by Cdc2 kinase can mediate transcription repression
      during mitosis. In addition, we show that phosphorylation of pol II with the
      human TFIIH-associated kinase Cdk7 also decreases transcription activity despite 
      a different pattern of CTD phosphorylation by this kinase. These results extend
      previous findings that RNA polymerase IIO is defective in preinitiation complex
      formation. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the CTD by
      cyclin-dependent kinases with different phosphoryl acceptor specificities can
      inhibit transcription in a CTD-dependent transcription system.

      expression system and further purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified
      recombinant cyclin H is similar to the endogenous one according to the following 
      criteria: molecular weight, microsequencing and mass spectra studies, ability to 
      interact with cdk7, and regulatory kinase activity. The scale-up of cyclin H
      purification is described.

TI  - Dual phosphorylation of the T-loop in cdk7: its role in controlling cyclin H
      binding and CAK activity.
PG  - 343-54
AB  - A cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-activating kinase (CAK) has been shown previously
      to catalyze T-loop phosphorylation of cdks in most eukaryotic cells. This enzyme 
      exists in either of two forms: the major one contains cdk7, cyclin H and an
      assembly factor called MAT-1, whilst the minor one lacks MAT-1. Cdk7 is unusual
      among cdks because it contains not one but two residues (S170 and T176 in Xenopus
      cdk7) in its T-loop that are phosphorylated in vivo. We have investigated the
      role of S170 and T176 phosphorylation in the assembly and activity of cyclin
      H-cdk7 dimers. In the absence of MAT-1, phosphorylation of the T-loop appears to 
      be required for cdk7 to bind cyclin H. Phosphorylation of both residues does not 
      require cyclin H binding in vitro. Phosphorylation of S170 is sufficient for cdk7
      to bind cyclin H with low affinity, but high affinity binding requires T176
      phosphorylation. By mutational analysis, we demonstrate that in addition to its
      role in promotion of cyclin H binding, S170 phosphorylation plays a direct role
      in the control of CAK activity. Finally, we show that dual phosphorylation of
      S170 and T176, or substitution of both phosphorylatable residues by aspartic
      residues, is sufficient to generate CAK activity to one-third of its maximal
      value in vitro, even in the absence of cyclin H and MAT-1, and may thus provide
      further clues as to how cyclins activate cdk subunits.

TI  - Protein kinase C inhibits the CAK-CDK2 cyclin-dependent kinase cascade and G1/S
      cell cycle progression in human diploid fibroblasts.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - Serum stimulation of human diploid fibroblast IMR-90 cells leads to
      phosphorylation of p33CDK2 at Thr160 and activation of CDK2 kinase, a necessary
      event for G1/S transition. We report that serum stimulation causes a gradual,
      sustained increase in the activity of CDK-activating kinase (CAK) that
      phosphorylates CDK2 at Thr160, which starts by 5 h after serum stimulation and
      reaches the maximal plateau level at around the G1/S boundary. In this cell type 
      addition of phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate 5 h but not 16 h after serum stimulation
      completely inhibits CDK2 kinase activation and DNA synthesis. Phorbol ester
      treatment does not reduce the protein level of p33CDK2, but does inhibit
      serum-stimulated increases in the CAK activity and CDK2 phosphorylation at
      Thr160. The suppression of the CAK activity by the phorbol ester is accompanied
      by decreases in the message levels of both CDK7 and cyclin H, the catalytic and
      the positive regulatory subunit of CAK, respectively. These results indicate that
      in IMR-90 cells activation of protein kinase C in the late G1 phase causes cell
      cycle arrest before the G1/S boundary at least in part through downregulation of 
      CAK and CAK-mediated CDK2 phosphorylation and activation.

TI  - Flavopiridol (L86 8275; NSC 649890), a new kinase inhibitor for tumor therapy.
PG  - 1143-68
AB  - Flavopiridol is a new synthetic flavone, structurally related to a natural
      alkaloid, originally purified from Dysoxylum binectariferum, a plant indigenous
      to India and used in Indian folk medicine. Flavopiridol was detected by a tandem 
      screening system consisting in inhibition of the EGF-receptor Tyrosine
      phosphokinase and cytotoxicity. As a cytostatic mechanism, however, Flavopiridol 
      strongly inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk1, cdk2, cdk4, cdk7), with the
      potential to cause inhibition of cell cycle progression in G(1) and G(2) by
      multiple mechanisms relatable to cdk inhibition. In certain cell types,
      Flavopiridol induces apoptosis. The antitumor activity of that compound on human 
      xenograft tumors is similar to standard cytostatic drugs and superior to them at 
      least in prostate carcinoma. The dose limiting toxicity is diarrhea. Compared
      with other flavonoids or other kinase inhibitors Flavopiridol can be regarded as 
      unique as no other compound is yet known that as specifically and potently
      inhibits nearly all the main cyclin dependent kinases and by that mechanisms can 
      arrest cell cycle progression in G(1) as well as in G(2) and no other specific
      kinase inhibitor is known, which after i.v. or oral application reduces the
      growth of subcutaneous or subrenal xenografts of human tumors of different types.
      Initial results of a phase I study at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA,
      (Investigational New Drug Application no. 46211) provided some clinical and
      laboratory evidence for antineoplastic effect at nontoxic doses (no grade IV
      toxicities encountered). Thus, Flavopiridol is clearly in need of further
      clinical evaluation of its tumor therapeutic potential. In this review the
      chemical profile, tumorpharmacology (in vitro activity, inhibition of cdk's and
      preclinical in vivo activity), preclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetic of
      Flavopiridol are reviewed to provide a comprehensive source to aid further
      developmental efforts.

PG  - 805-13
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) play a central role in the regulation of the
      eukaryotic cell cycle. A novel gene encoding a Cdk-like protein, Pfmrk, has been 
      isolated from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The gene has no
      introns and comprises an open reading frame encoding a protein of 324 amino acids
      with a predicted molecular mass of 38 kDa. Database searches revealed a striking 
      similarity to the Cdk subfamily with the highest similarity to human MO15 (Cdk7).
      The overall sequence of Pfmrk shares 62% similarity and 46% identity with human
      MO15, in comparison to the 49-58% similarity and 34-43% identity with other human
      Cdks. Pfmrk contains two unique inserts: one consisting of 5 amino acids just
      before the cyclin-binding motif and the other composed of 13 amino acids within
      the T-loop equivalent region. Southern blots of genomic DNA digests and
      chromosomal separations showed that Pfmrk is a single-copy gene conserved between
      several parasite strains and is located on chromosome 10. A 2500-nucleotide
      transcript of this gene is expressed predominantly in the sexual blood stages
      (gametocytes), suggesting that Pfmrk may be involved in sexual stage development.

TI  - A cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK) in budding yeast unrelated to
      vertebrate CAK.
PG  - 1714-7
AB  - Progress through the cell cycle is governed by the cyclin-dependent kinases
      (CDKs), the activation of which requires phosphorylation by the CDK-activating
      kinase (CAK). In vertebrates, CAK is a trimeric enzyme containing CDK7, cyclin H,
      and MAT1. CAK from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was identified as
      an unusual 44-kilodalton protein kinase, Cak1, that is only distantly related to 
      CDKs. Cak1 accounted for most CAK activity in yeast cell lysates, and its
      activity was constant throughout the cell cycle. The CAK1 gene was essential for 
      cell viability. Thus, the major CAK in S. cerevisiae is distinct from the
      vertebrate enzyme, suggesting that budding yeast and vertebrates may have evolved
      different mechanisms of CDK activation.

TI  - Human glioblastomas with no alterations of the CDKN2A (p16INK4A, MTS1) and CDK4
      genes have frequent mutations of the retinoblastoma gene.
PG  - 1065-72
AB  - A series of 195 human gliomas were studied as to the status of their CDKN2A, CDK4
      and RB1 genes. Among 120 glioblastomas, 40% had no wild-type CDKN2A gene, 12%
      amplified the CDK4 gene, and 14% had no wild-type RBI gene. With two exceptions, 
      each tumour had only one of these abnormalities. Thus the majority of the
      glioblastomas (64%) had distinct genetic aberrations which would obviously
      disrupt the control of transition from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle. A
      further 30% had loss of one allele of the CDKN2A and/or RBI genes. Only seven
      (6%) glioblastomas had no abnormalities of these genes. Anaplastic astrocytomas
      showed similar changes to the glioblastomas but at lower frequencies-34% showing 
      no aberrations of the genes analysed. The astrocytomas showed solely loss of one 
      allele of the RBI gene in 28% of tumours, with retention of one wild-type copy.
      In the glioblastomas with no alterations of CDKN2A, CDK4 or RB1, several other
      genes (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK6, E2F, CDK7, MYC and MYCN) whose products take
      part in cell cycle regulation were examined. No abnormalities were detected. Thus
      some aberration of the CDKN2A, CDK4 and RB1 genes appears to be almost obligatory
      in glioblastomas.

PG  - 6488-93
AB  - Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a multisubunit complex required for
      transcription and for DNA nucleotide excision repair. TFIIH possesses three
      enzymatic activities: (i) an ATP-dependent DNA helicase, (ii) a DNA-dependent
      ATPase, and (iii) a kinase with specificity for the carboxyl-terminal domain of
      RNA polymerase II. The kinase activity was recently identified as the cdk
      (cyclin-dependent kinase) activating kinase, CAK, composed of cdk7, cyclin H, and
      MAT-1. Here we report the isolation and characterization of three distinct
      CAK-containing complexes from HeLa nuclear extracts: CAK, a novel CAK-ERCC2
      complex, and TFIIH. CAK-ERCC2 can efficiently associate with core-TFIIH to
      reconstitute holo-TFIIH transcription activity. We present evidence proposing a
      critical role for ERCC2 in mediating the association of CAK with core TFIIH
      subunits.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of two human transcription factor IIH
      (TFIIH)-related complexes: ERCC2/CAK and TFIIH.
PG  - 6482-7
AB  - Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a multisubunit protein complex essential for 
      both the initiation of RNA polymerase class II (pol II)-catalyzed transcription
      and nucleotide excision repair of DNA. Recent studies have shown that TFIIH
      copurifies with the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-activating kinase complex (CAK)
      that includes cdk7, cyclin H, and p36/MAT1. Here we report the isolation of two
      TFIIH-related complexes: TFIIH* and ERCC2/CAK. TFIIH* consists of a subset of the
      TFIIH complex proteins including ERCC3 (XPB), p62, p44, p41, and p34 but is
      devoid of detectable levels of ERCC2 (XPD) and CAK. ERCC2/CAK was isolated as a
      complex that exhibits CAK activity that cosediments with the three CAK components
      (cdk7, cyclin H, and p36/MAT1) as well as the ERCC2 (XPD) protein. TFIIH* can
      support pol II-catalyzed transcription in vitro with lower efficiency compared
      with TFIIH. This TFIIH*-dependent transcription reaction was stimulated by
      ERCC2/CAK. The ERCC2/CAK and TFIIH* complexes are each active in DNA repair as
      shown by their ability to complement extracts prepared from ERCC2 (XPD)- and
      ERCC3 (XPB)-deficient cells, respectively, in supporting the excision of DNA
      containing a cholesterol lesion. These data suggest that TFIIH* and ERCC2/CAK
      interact to form the TFIIH holoenzyme capable of efficiently assembling the pol
      II transcription initiation complex and directly participating in excision repair
      reactions.

TI  - Expression of CDK7/CAK in normal and tumor cells of diverse histogenesis,
      cell-cycle position and differentiation.
PG  - 732-7
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) represents the 40-kDa catalytic subunit of
      the CDK-activating kinase, the enzyme responsible for activatory phosphorylation 
      of multiple CDKs controlling G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Here, we
      surveyed a wide range of normal and tumour cell types, in both cell culture and
      biopsy specimens, for abundance and subcellular localisation of the CDK7 protein.
      Immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analyses showed that CDK7 was (i)
      ubiquitously expressed in all cell types examined; (ii) exclusively nuclear;
      (iii) moderately elevated in tumour cells when compared with their normal cell
      counterparts; (iv) invariant throughout the cell cycle of normal lymphocytes,
      fibroblasts, breast epithelium and several cancer cell lines; and (v) clearly
      detectable even in quiescent cells, including highly differentiated cell types in
      situ. Our data are consistent with the emerging role for CDK7/CAK in multiple
      biological processes, possibly providing a link between cell-cycle control,
      transcriptional regulation and genomic integrity control.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase 7: at the cross-roads of transcription, DNA repair and
      cell cycle control?
PG  - 312-7
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 7 was originally implicated in cell cycle control
      by virtue of its ability to phosphorylate and activate other CDKs. Subsequently, 
      both CDK7 and its partner, cyclin H, were found to be associated with the general
      transcription factor TFIIH, suggesting additional roles for CDK7 in transcription
      and DNA repair. During the past year, a third subunit associated with CDK7 and
      cyclin H has been characterized, and the functional link between CDK7 and RNA
      polymerase II has been strengthened.

TI  - Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (Cdk2) forms an inactive complex with cyclin D1 since
      Cdk2 associated with cyclin D1 is not phosphorylated by Cdk7-cyclin-H.
PG  - 460-7
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) form complexes with cyclins, and as a consequence
      they generally express kinase activities. One of these Cdks, Cdk2, is known to
      bind with cyclins A and E, and plays an important role in the progression of the 
      cell cycle via phosphorylation of target proteins such as the product of the
      retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene (pRB). It has been suggested that Cdk2 bound
      with cyclin D1 and Cdk2-cyclin-D1 complex show neither H1 histone nor pRB kinase 
      activity. However, it is not clear whether Cdk2-cyclin-D1 has unknown targets and
      why Cdk2 is not activated by binding with cyclin D1. We investigated these
      questions using Cdk, cyclin and Cdk-cyclin complexes produced in a baculovirus
      expression system. Cdk2 formed a complex with cyclin D1 in this system. After
      extensive purification, Cdk2 was still bound to cyclin D1. The Cdk2-cyclin-D1
      complex did not phosphorylate any tested substrates, such as H1 histone, pRB,
      SV40 large T antigen, p53, E2F-1 or a preparation of nuclear proteins from HeLa
      cells; in contrast, Cdk2-cyclin-E and Cdk2-cyclin-A phosphorylated these
      proteins. Moreover, the Cdk2-cyclin-D1 complex was not activated by incubation
      with Cdk4 or cyclin E. Thus, Cdk2 and cyclin D1 formed a stable complex that was 
      not activated. In order to determine why Cdk2-cyclin-D1 lacks kinase activity, we
      investigated the phosphorylation of Cdk2. Under-shifted Cdk2, the active form of 
      Cdk2, was not detected in the Cdk2-cyclin-D1 complex in the baculovirus system.
      In human WI-38 cells, cyclin D1 began to form a complex with Cdk2 as well as with
      Cdk4 from the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle. The Cdk2 bound to cyclin D1 in
      human cells was also the inactive form that was slowly migrated. Moreover, we
      found that Cdk2 bound to cyclin D1 was not phosphorylated by Cdk7-cyclin-H, while
      Cdk2 bound to cyclin E, as well as free Cdk2, was was phosphorylated by
      Cdk7-cyclin-H. Additionally, Cdk2 phosphorylated by Cdk7-cyclin-H did not bind to
      cyclin D1. These results strongly suggest that Cdk2 forms a stable complex with
      cyclin D1 but is not activated because the Cdk2 molecule in the complex is not
      phosphorylated by Cdk7-cyclin-H and the phosphorylated Cdk2, an active form, does
      not bind to cyclin D1.

TI  - MAT1, cdk7 and cyclin H form a kinase complex which is UV light-sensitive upon
      association with TFIIH.
PG  - 1877-84
AB  - MAT1, cyclin H and cdk7 are part of TFIIH, a class II transcription factor which 
      possesses numerous subunits of which several have been shown to be involved in
      processes other than transcription. Two of them, XPD (ERCC2) and XPB (ERCC3), are
      helicases involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), whereas cdk7, cyclin H
      and MAT1 are thought to participate in cell cycle regulation. MAT1, cyclin H and 
      cdk7 exist as a ternary complex either free or associated with TFIIH from which
      the latter can be dissociated at high salt concentration. MAT1 is strongly
      associated with cdk7 and cyclin H. Although not strictly required for the
      formation and activity of the complex, it stimulates its kinase activity. The
      kinase activity of TFIIH, which is constant during the cell cycle, is reduced
      after UV light irradiation.

TI  - Reaction mechanism of human DNA repair excision nuclease.
PG  - 8285-94
AB  - Nucleotide excision repair consists of removal of the damaged nucleotide(s) from 
      DNA by dual incision of the damaged strand on both sides of the lesion, followed 
      by filling of the resulting gap and ligation. In humans, 14-16 polypeptides are
      required for the dual incision step. We have purified the required proteins to
      homogeneity and reconstituted the dual incision activity (excision nuclease) in a
      defined enzyme/substrate system. The system was highly efficient, removing >30%
      of the thymine dimers under optimal conditions. All of the six fractions that
      constitute the excision nuclease were required for dual incision of the thymine
      dimer substrate. However, when a cholesterol-substituted oligonucleotide was used
      as substrate, excision occurred in the absence of the XPC-HHR23B complex,
      reminiscent of transcription-coupled repair in the XP-C mutant cell line.
      Replication protein A is absolutely required for both incisions. The XPG subunit 
      is essential to the formation of the preincision complex, but the repair complex 
      can assemble and produce normal levels of 3'-incision in the absence of
      XPF-ERCC1. Kinetic experiments revealed that the 3'-incision precedes the
      5'-incision. Consistent with the kinetic data, uncoupled 5'-incision was never
      observed in the reconstituted system. Two forms of TFIIH were used in the
      reconstitution reaction, one containing the CDK7-cyclin H pair and one lacking
      it. Both forms were equally active in excision. The excised oligomer dissociated 
      from the gapped DNA in a nucleoprotein complex. In total, these results provide a
      detailed account of the reactions occurring during damage removal by human
      excision nuclease.

TI  - The amino terminus of Cdk2 binds p21.
PG  - 343-52
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor known as p21, which is
      transcriptionally regulated by p53, can induce G1 arrest when overexpressed and
      inhibit the kinase activity of a wide variety of cyclin-Cdk complexes. Previous
      studies have demonstrated that a portion of the conserved region of p21 (amino
      acids 46-78), which is homologous to similar regions in the related Cdk
      inhibitors p27 and p57, can bind to Cdk2, and that this region is essential for
      kinase inhibition. However, the site(s) on Cdk2 that are involved in p21 binding 
      have not been identified. We therefore created mutant Cdk2 molecules with various
      N-terminal and C-terminal deletions and tested each for their ability to bind to 
      p21 by the yeast two-hybrid and the double-tagging assays. None of the deletion
      mutants tested bound to p21 by either assay. We next tested whether p21 could
      bind to Cdk7, a component of the cyclin-activating kinase complex. By both the
      double-tagging and yeast two-hybrid assays, p21 failed to bind to this protein,
      consistent with previous reports. However, hybrid molecules consisting of the
      amino-terminal half of Cdk2 and the carboxy-terminal half of Cdk7 (Cdk2/Cdk7)
      could bind to p21 by both assays, whereas the Cdk7/Cdk2 hybrids could not.
      Furthermore, the yeast Cdc28 protein, which is 65% identical with Cdk2, failed to
      bind to p21 by both the yeast two-hybrid and double-tagging assays. Cdk2/Cdc28
      hybrids but not Cdc28/Cdk2 hybrids could bind to p21. These results suggest that 
      the amino-terminal half of Cdk2 is important for p21 binding, consistent with the
      recently published crystal-lographic data. Our data also suggest that the
      three-dimensional structure of Cdk2 is likely altered by creating deletion
      mutants from either the amino- or carboxy-terminal end of the protein. Finally,
      we have mutated the Cdc28/Cdk2 hybrid protein and isolated several mutants, which
      are able to bind to p21. This approach may be useful for identifying residues in 
      Cdk2 and Cdc28 that affect their ability to bind to p21 and complement the
      crystallographic data.

TI  - Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mop1-Mcs2 is related to mammalian CAK.
PG  - 6164-72
AB  - The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase, CAK, from mammals and
      amphibians consists of MO15/CDK7 and cyclin H, a complex which has been
      identified also as a RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase. While the 
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2 gene product also requires an activating
      phosphorylation, the enzyme responsible has not been identified. We have isolated
      an essential S.pombe gene, mop1, whose product is closely related to MO15 and to 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kin28. The functional similarity of Mop1 and MO15 is
      reflected in the ability of MO15 to rescue a mop1 null allele. This suggests that
      Mop1 would be a CDK, and indeed Mop1 associates with a previously characterized
      cyclin H-related cyclin Mcs2 of S.pombe. Also, Mop1 and Mcs2 can associate with
      the heterologous partners human cyclin H and MO15, respectively. Moreover, the
      rescue of a temperature-sensitive mcs2 strain by expression of mop1+ demonstrates
      a genetic interaction between mop1 and mcs2. In a functional assay,
      immunoprecipitated Mop1-Mcs2 acts both as an RNA polymerase II CTD kinase and as 
      a CAK. The CAK activity of Mop1-Mcs2 distinguishes it from the related CDK-cyclin
      pair Kin28-Ccl1 from S.cerevisiae, and supports the notion that Mop1-Mcs2 may
      represent a homolog of MO15-cyclin H in S.pombe with apparent dual roles as a RNA
      polymerase CTD kinase and as a CAK.

TI  - Molecular cloning of CDK7-associated human MAT1, a cyclin-dependent
      kinase-activating kinase (CAK) assembly factor.
PG  - 6058-62
AB  - Mammalian CDK7 is a protein kinase identified as the catalytic subunit of
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase and as an essential component of 
      the transcription factor TFIIH that is involved in transcription initiation and
      DNA repair. We have identified in human cells a number of CDK7-associated
      cellular proteins that appear to fall into two classes based on their relative
      [35S] metabolic labeling intensity. One class of proteins present in CDK7
      immunocomplexes as a minor fraction contains components of the TFIIH
      transcription complex such as p62 and p89ERCC3, whereas the other fraction
      contains four polypeptides (p35, p37Cyclin H, p75, and p95) that are
      stoichiometrically associated with CDK7. Whereas the levels of association of
      p35, p37Cyclin H, and p75 with CDK7 remain unchanged between density-arrested and
      proliferating Ewing sarcoma EW-1 cells, the association of p95 with CDK7 was
      significantly decreased as cells reached confluency. Through a large-scale
      immunopurification of CDK7 complexes and protein microsequencing, we have
      isolated a cDNA that encodes p35 and have shown that it is the human homologue of
      Mat1 that is involved in the assembly of CAK. MAT1 contains a highly conserved
      C3HC4 motif at its NH2 terminus, a characteristic feature shared among RING
      finger proteins. The human MAT1 gene expresses a single 1.6-kb transcript, the
      steady-state level of which, like CDK7 and cyclin H, varies significantly in
      different cell lines and in different terminally differentiated tissues.

TI  - Interferon modulates the messenger RNA of G1-controlling genes to suppress the
      G1-to-S transition in Daudi cells.
PG  - 149-58
AB  - Interferon (IFN) is one of the potent antiproliferative cytokines and is used to 
      treat some selected cancers. IFN arrests the growth of Burkitt Lymphoma derived
      cell line Daudi cells in the G1 phase. G1-to-S progression is controlled by
      positive and negative regulatory genes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of
      IFN on G1-controlling genes. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks 2, 3,
      4, 5, 6), MO15/Cdk7, and cyclins E and H was studied to assess positive
      regulators, while p15Ink4B, p16Ink4, p18, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 were assessed as
      negative regulators. Cdks 2, 4, 6 and cyclin E were markedly down-regulated.
      MO15/Cdk7 expression showed little change, but its regulatory subunit (cyclin H) 
      was down-regulated like cyclin E. Expression of p15Ink4B and p16Ink4 was not
      observed. p18 was induced until 48 h and its expression returned to the initial
      level at 72 h. In contrast, p21Cip1 mRNA expression remained at the baseline
      level throughout IFN treatment, while the expression of p27Kip1 increased at 48
      and 72 h. Taken together, these data indicate that IFN changes the messenger RNA 
      of G1-controlling genes towards the suppression of G1-to-S transition.

TI  - In vitro assembly of a functional human CDK7-cyclin H complex requires MAT1, a
      novel 36 kDa RING finger protein.
PG  - 5608-17
AB  - It is proposed that the CDK7-cyclin H complex functions in cell cycle
      progression, basal transcription and DNA repair. Here we report that in vitro
      reconstitution of an active CDK7-cyclin H complex requires stoichiometric amounts
      of a novel 36 kDa assembly factor termed MAT1 (menage a trois 1). Sequencing of
      MAT1 reveals a putative zinc binding motif (a C3HC4 RING finger) in the
      N-terminus; however, this domain is not required for ternary complex formation
      with CDK7-cyclin H. MAT1 is associated with nuclear CDK7-cyclin H at all stages
      of the cell cycle in vivo. Ternary complexes of CDK7, cyclin H and MAT1 display
      kinase activity towards substrates mimicking both the T-loop in CDKs and the
      C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, regardless of whether they are
      immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells or reconstituted in a reticulocyte lysate.
      MAT1 constitutes the first example of an assembly factor that appears to be
      essential for the formation of an active CDK-cyclin complex.

TI  - MAT1 ('menage a trois') a new RING finger protein subunit stabilizing cyclin
      H-cdk7 complexes in starfish and Xenopus CAK.
PG  - 5027-36
AB  - The kinase responsible for Thr161-Thr160 phosphorylation and activation of
      cdc2/cdk2 (CAK:cdk-activating kinase) has been shown previously to comprise at
      least two subunits, cdk7 and cyclin H. An additional protein co-purified with CAK
      in starfish oocytes, but its sequencing did not reveal any similarity with any
      known protein. In the present work, a cDNA encoding this protein is cloned and
      sequenced in both starfish and Xenopus oocytes. It is shown to encode a new
      member of the RING finger family of proteins with a characteristic C3HC4 motif
      located in the N-terminal domain. We demonstrate that the RING finger protein
      (MAT1: 'menage a trois') is a new subunit of CAK in both vertebrate and
      invertebrates. However, CAK may also exist in oocytes as heterodimeric complexes 
      between cyclin H and cdk7 only. Stable heterotrimeric CAK complexes were
      generated in reticulocyte lysates programmed with mRNAs encoding Xenopus cdk7,
      cyclin H and MAT1. In contrast, no heterodimeric cyclin H-cdk7 complex could be
      immunoprecipitated from reticulocyte lysates programmed with cdk7 and cyclin H
      mRNAs only. Stabilization of CAK complexes by MAT1 does not involve
      phosphorylation of Thr176, as the Thr176-->Ala mutant of Xenopus cdk7 could
      engage as efficiently as wild-type cdk7 in ternary complexes. Even though
      starfish MAT1 is almost identical to Xenopus MAT1 in the RING finger domain, the 
      starfish subunit could not replace the Xenopus subunit and stabilize cyclin
      H-cdk7 in reticulocyte lysate, suggesting that the MAT1 subunit does not (or not 
      only) interact with cyclin H-cdk7 through the RING finger domain.

TI  - Alternative mechanisms of CAK assembly require an assembly factor or an
      activating kinase.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - We have cloned a mouse cDNA that encodes p36, a novel subunit of the
      CDK-activating kinase (CAK). p36 contains a C3HC4 zinc-binding domain or RING
      factor and is associated both with a TFIIH-bound form of CAK and with a free
      trimeric form. p36 promotes the assembly of CDK7 and cyclin H in vitro,
      stabilizing the transient CDK7-cyclin H complex. Stabilization and activation of 
      CAK by p36 is independent of the phosphorylation state of T170, the conserved
      activating residue of CDK7. Assembly of active CDK7-cyclin H dimers can also
      occur through an alternative p36-independent pathway that requires
      phosphorylation of T170 by a CAK-activating kinase, or CAKAK. Thus, CDK7-cyclin H
      complex formation can be achieved by multiple mechanisms.

TI  - A mammalian RNA polymerase II holoenzyme containing all components required for
      promoter-specific transcription initiation.
PG  - 137-46
AB  - The protein kinase MO15/CDK7 has recently been shown to be associated with the
      general transcription factor TFIIH and to be capable of phosphorylating the RNA
      polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain. Here, we show that a monoclonal MO15/CDK7 
      antibody coimmunoprecipitates, from a rat liver nuclear extract, all components
      of the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus required for initiation at the
      albumin and adenovirus major late promoters. The immunoprecipitate includes RNA
      polymerase II, TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIH, TFIIF, and TFIIE, but is devoid of
      transcriptional activator proteins, such as HNF1, HNF4, and C/EBP alpha. The
      finding of an autonomously initiating RNA polymerase II holoenzyme in mammalian
      cells suggests conceptual similarities between transcription initiation in
      prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

TI  - KIN28 encodes a C-terminal domain kinase that controls mRNA transcription in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae but lacks cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase
      (CAK) activity.
PG  - 2983-92
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene KIN28 is a member of the cyclin-dependent
      kinase (CDK) family. The Kin28 protein shares extensive sequence identity with
      the vertebrate CDK-activating kinase MO15 (Cdk7), which phosphorylates CDKs in
      vitro on a critical threonine residue. Kin28 and MO15 have recently been found to
      copurify with the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) holoenzyme of yeast and human 
      cells, respectively. Although TFIIH is capable of phosphorylating the C-terminal 
      domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, it has been unclear whether Kin28 is the
      physiologically relevant CTD kinase or what role CTD phosphorylation plays in
      transcription. In this study, we used a thermosensitive allele of KIN28 and a
      hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Kin28 protein to investigate Kin28 function in
      transcription and in the cell cycle. We show that Kin28 acts as a positive
      regulator of mRNA transcription in vivo and possesses CTD kinase activity in
      vitro. However, Kin28 neither regulates the phosphorylation state of the yeast
      cell cycle CDK, Cdc28, nor possesses CDK-activating kinase activity in vitro. We 
      conclude that Kin28 is a strong candidate for the physiological CTD kinase of S. 
      cerevisiae and that Kin28 function is required for mRNA transcription.

TI  - News on initiation and elongation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 352-61
AB  - Transcription by RNA polymerase II is a complex process that requires additional 
      factors to initiate transcription at the promoters. New developments in the past 
      year have furthered our understanding of the functions of the transcription
      factors and provided more insights into the mechanisms involved in the regulation
      of initiation and elongation of transcription. One of the most significant
      advances of the past year was the discovery of the involvement of the general
      transcription factor TFIIH in DNA excision repair. Surprisingly, studies aimed at
      identifying the kinase activity within TFIIH responsible for phosphorylating the 
      carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II revealed it to be the MO15/Cdk7
      kinase and its partner, cyclin H. These exciting observations suggest a paradigm 
      for linking transcription, DNA excision repair and cell cycle progression through
      one pivotal factor.

TI  - Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases by p21.
PG  - 387-400
AB  - p21Cip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor that is transcriptionally
      activated by p53 in response to DNA damage. We have explored the interaction of
      p21 with the currently known Cdks. p21 effectively inhibits Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, and
      Cdk6 kinases (Ki 0.5-15 nM) but is much less effective toward Cdc2/cyclin B (Ki
      approximately 400 nM) and Cdk5/p35 (Ki > 2 microM), and does not associate with
      Cdk7/cyclin H. Overexpression of P21 arrests cells in G1. Thus, p21 is not a
      universal inhibitor of Cdks but displays selectivity for G1/S Cdk/cyclin
      complexes. Association of p21 with Cdks is greatly enhanced by cyclin binding.
      This property is shared by the structurally related inhibitor p27, suggesting a
      common biochemical mechanism for inhibition. With respect to Cdk2 and Cdk4
      complexes, p27 shares the inhibitory potency of p21 but has slightly different
      kinase specificities. In normal diploid fibroblasts, the vast majority of active 
      Cdk2 is associated with p21, but this active kinase can be fully inhibited by
      addition of exogenous p21. Reconstruction experiments using purified components
      indicate that multiple molecules of p21 can associate with Cdk/cyclin complexes
      and inactive complexes contain more than one molecule of p21. Together, these
      data suggest a model whereby p21 functions as an inhibitory buffer whose levels
      determine the threshold kinase activity required for cell cycle progression.

TI  - Association of Cdk-activating kinase subunits with transcription factor TFIIH.
PG  - 280-2
AB  - The RNA polymerase II large subunit contains an essential carboxy-terminal domain
      (CTD) believed to be involved in the response to regulators during transcription 
      initiation. The CTD is phosphorylated on a portion of RNA polymerase II molecules
      in vivo and it can be phosphorylated by the general transcription factor TFIIH in
      vitro. A highly purified TFIIH from rat liver has been described; this, like
      human and yeast TFIIH, contains associated CTD kinase and helicase activities. We
      report here that two polypeptides of the purified mammalian TFIIH are the
      MO15/Cdk7 kinase and cyclin H subunits of the Cdk-activating kinase Cak,
      previously identified as a positive regulator of Cdc2 and Cdk2. TFIIH and Cak
      preparations are each capable of phosphorylating recombinant CTD and recombinant 
      Cdk2 proteins. The presence of Cak in TFIIH indicates that Cak may have roles in 
      transcriptional regulation and in cell-cycle control.

TI  - Cdk-activating kinase complex is a component of human transcription factor TFIIH.
PG  - 283-7
AB  - Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) contains a kinase capable of phosphorylating the
      carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II
      (RNAPII). Here we report the identification of the Cdk-activating kinase (Cak)
      complex (Cdk7 and cyclin H) as a component of TFIIH after extensive purification 
      of TFIIH by chromatography. We find that affinity-purified antibodies directed
      against cyclin H inhibit TFIIH-dependent transcription and that both cyclin H and
      Cdk7 antibodies inhibit phosphorylation of the CTD of the largest subunit of the 
      RNAPII in the preinitiation complex. Cak is present in at least two distinct
      complexes, TFIIH and a smaller complex that is unable to phosphorylate RNAPII in 
      the preinitiation complex. Both Cak complexes, as well as recombinant Cak,
      phosphorylate a CTD peptide. Finally, TFIIH was shown to phosphorylate both Cdc2 
      and Cdk2, suggesting that there could be a link between transcription and the
      cell cycle machinery.

TI  - The regulation and functions of cdk7.
PG  - 229-40
AB  - cdk7 started its life rather anonymously as a kinase called MO15, identified
      during a search for cDNA's which encode protein kinases related to cdc2. For
      several years its function remained obscure, but during the last 18 months MO15
      has revealed itself as the catalytic subunit of cdk activating kinase,
      associating with at least two other subunits including a new cyclin, cyclin H.
      MO15(cdk7) has therefore been established paradoxically as both a new member and 
      a regulator of the cyclin dependent kinase family. New evidence now suggests that
      cdk7 is also involved in the processes of transcription initiation and DNA
      repair, associating with the general transcription factor TFIIH. The engima of
      cdk7 is likely to remain for a while yet, and perhaps even more surprises are in 
      store.

PG  - 221-35
AB  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) is a family of serine-threonine kinases whose
      principal role is the promotion of the cell transition through the regulatory
      points of the cell cycle (G1 and G2/M). The best known human cdks are: cdk1-cdk7 
      and p58-GTA. The latter one, contrarily to the other cdks, is supposed to act as 
      a antiproliferative factor. Most cdks may be involved in the development of
      neoplastic disorders. This hypothesis is based on their biological features
      (interactions with viral oncoproteins), their hyperexpression in some
      malignancies and frequent deletions of cdk inhibitory genes in cancer cells.
      cdk5, which displays the maximal kinase activity in non-proliferating brain
      neurons may participate in the pathogeny of the Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - A novel cyclin associates with MO15/CDK7 to form the CDK-activating kinase.
PG  - 713-24
AB  - Phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is a required step in the
      activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. We have purified CAK from mammalian
      cells; the enzyme comprises two major polypeptides of 42 and 37 kDa. Protein
      sequencing indicates that the 42 kDa subunit is the mammalian homolog of MO15, a 
      protein kinase known to be a component of CAK in amphibians and echinoderms.
      Cloning of a cDNA encoding the 37 kDa subunit identifies it as a novel cyclin
      (cyclin H). We have reconstituted CAK in vitro with the MO15 catalytic subunit
      and cyclin H, demonstrating that MO15 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK7). Like
      other CDKs, MO15/CDK7 contains a conserved threonine required for full activity; 
      mutation of this residue severely reduces CAK activity. The CAK holoenzyme
      activates complexes of CDK2 and CDC2 with various cyclins and also phosphorylates
      CDK2, but not CDC2, in the absence of cyclin. Thus, CAK is a CDK-cyclin complex
      implicated in the control of multiple cell cycle transitions.
